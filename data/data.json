The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

It's not because I don't know my answer, but because I want to feel like I still doubt it. I raise my head. Gaelin meets my eyes and looks up to the canopy.\n\nHe leans his shoulder into me and drops his voice to a whisper. \"My Clip's  a good one, but you need to realize Ghosts don't know anything. Nobody does. They're just like us. They get curious. They question. If you think something's coming unwound, you need to sit down and talk it out.\"\n\n\"Wait\u2026 did Clip change yo\u2014\"\n\n\"Please,\" Gaelin scoffs. \"You're paranoid.\" He turns to keep walking and calls back, \"Life changes you. Same with them. I'm the only one that stays the same.\"\n\nGaelin raises a fist and we stop. His war beast sniffs the air and turns us east. We continue walking.\n\n\"What'd you name the beast?\"\n\n\"Castus.\"\n\n\"You've been reading too many of the Spider's books .\"\n\n\"Some of 'em are good.\"\n\nI laugh. \"Aren't you the man that said anything you got tying you down can be made into a noose?\"\n\n\"Yeah, some time ago.\"\n\n\"You've been taking a lot of jobs with him ?

I have completed my sweep through the Reef and am filing an incident report hence forth referred to as Inc-01, should it be referenced.\n\nShuffling is heard as the speaker adjusts. Papers sift and the microphone crackles slightly. \n\nRc-9: The basis of my visit to the Tangled Shore was to conduct routine Vanguard/Reef security sweeps, as agreed upon since the day of incursion. I was escorted most of the way to the Shore by Awoken gunships, and only landed once my long-range scanner picked up a sub-audio reading emanating from the underbelly of one of the larger asteroid landmasses. \n\nThe speaker clears their throat. \n\nRc-9: I called in the disturbance to a nearby Awoken vessel and was told to, and I quote, \"Mind my own business and be on my way,\" so naturally, I thanked them for their assistance, feigned departure, and landed to check it out. They didn't seem to notice the signal. At the signal's source, I discovered a small camp of what I initially thought were Scorn. Upon further observation, I found that these were not Scorn but Fallen afflicted with some kind of flesh deformity and mental degradation. Shot one dead and the others just looked at me. They didn't fight back. Fired a few cesium charges into the asteroid hole and watched 'em burn. Just sat there. I didn't hear it clearly, but they were chanting something. I don't know. Hard to hear over the fire. \n\nThe speaker laughs to themselves and emulates popping noises. \n\nRc-9: I heard more of them whispering a little deeper in, so I waited for the area to burn out and continued inside. I found one structure of apparent Hive architecture, though it did not appear to have been constructed in any traditional sense\u2026 but then again, I don't know what I should even expect from the Hive at this point. A single Fallen was inside, became violent when I approached and brandished a weapon. The weapon was not loaded, and I put them down. \n\nRc-9: My logs will show a few recovered pieces of equipment that I will list now. One presumably organic section of the Hive structure. It is perpetually wet, just\u2026 great job on that, and causes dizziness and blurred vision when held with ungloved hands. It also has the unnerving ability to project dysphoria or general unease. I was asked to collect a sample for study by my CO. I've done that. Put it in a lead box all the way in the back of the cargo hold. Yeah. Eternal tithings to Xivu Arath. Whatever. Um\u2026 as I was saying. \n\nA tin is heard being unlatched. \n\nRc-9: Also recovered: one tube-style Grenade Launcher. It has no foundry markings. Definitely not Fallen, and I don't think the Scorn even know how to make weapons. Do the Awoken make Grenade Launchers? Always struck me as a Human weapon. Beautiful weapon. The thing wants to be used. Maybe I'll get an opportunity to use it before I get back to the Tower. Lastly, I recovered a locational tracker from one of the Fallen. Following it back to someplace else in the Reef. Little remote. I'll call in my findings once I've finished there. \n\nRc-9: Beautiful weapon. \n\nThe recording cuts.",

And the crates.\" He does his best to appear compliant by tamping down his quills. \n\n\"Gone. In the middle of the Reef. On foot. With over a million Glimmer in weapons. Something about this doesn't add up.\" Spider motions to Avrok and Ahrrha, who advance on Brivi with Molten Welders raised. \"But we'll get to the truth of things soon enough.\" \n\nBrivi begins to panic. \"Please, Baron Spider. If it were not truth, I would not come back.\" Avrok prepares to melt off one of Brivi's upper arms, and looks to the Spider for the order. \n\nBefore Spider can speak, Crow steps forward from the wings. \"If I may, my Baron\u2026\" \n\nSpider gestures for Avrok to hold, and turns his attention to the Lightbearer. \"What is it? If you don't have the stomach for my discipline, you have permission to leave the room.\" \n\n\"It's not that, Baron. It's just that Brivi's account is consistent with several other instances Glint and I have seen out on the Reef. We think it has something to do with those Hive constructs.\" Crow spares a sympathetic glance toward the prostrate Brivi. \"Besides, what Brivi says is true. If he were in on the theft, he wouldn't have come back. If you'll just allow Glint and me to retrace his steps, we may find out what happened to the road crew. Who knows\u2026 we may even retrieve the weapons.\" \n\nSpider relaxes in his throne. \"Very well, Crow. Go find my weapons. And if you locate the road crew, you know what to do.\" \n\n\"Yes, Baron.\" Crow turn on a heel and strides from the room. \n\nBehind him, he hears the Spider growl, \"Avork, you may proceed.\"",
