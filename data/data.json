Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

It's not because I don't know my answer, but because I want to feel like I still doubt it. I raise my head. Gaelin meets my eyes and looks up to the canopy.\n\nHe leans his shoulder into me and drops his voice to a whisper. \"My Clip's  a good one, but you need to realize Ghosts don't know anything.

If you think something's coming unwound, you need to sit down and talk it out.\"\n\n\"Wait\u2026 did Clip change yo\u2014\"\n\n\"Please,\" Gaelin scoffs. \"You're paranoid.\" He turns to keep walking and calls back, \"Life changes you. Same with them. I'm the only one that stays the same.\"\n\nGaelin raises a fist and we stop. His war beast sniffs the air and turns us east. We continue walking.\n\n\"What'd you name the beast?\"\n\n\"Castus.\"\n\n\"You've been reading too many of the Spider's books .\"\n\n\"Some of 'em are good.\"\n\nI laugh. \"Aren't you the man that said anything you got tying you down can be made into a noose?\"\n\n\"Yeah, some time ago.\"\n\n\"You've been taking a lot of jobs with him ?

He squinted as a ripple rolled high overhead, and the grid seemed to move closer, like an enormous sheet settling over the City.\n\nA wave of pressure pushed down, building in his sinuses. He pressed a hand to his eyes. A deep thrum filled his head, and he heard their claws on the walls all around him, their hissing laughter.\n\nHe turned toward the street, weapon raised. He felt his heart thudding in his chest and sweat beading on his back.\n\nAnother noise: someone pounding on glass behind him.\n\nHe spun and one of them was in his house, looking out at him through the window. His sweaty fingers fumbled to turn the safety off as it opened its mouth\u2014\n\n\"Dad,\" the Fallen shouted, \"you're standing in the garden!\"\n\nHe looked down dumbly. Cherry tomatoes were crushed beneath his bare feet.\n\nHis son yelled again, no longer a Fallen, merely irritated and half asleep. \"Come back inside!\"\n\nHands shaking, he stepped out of the garden.

If anything, it's good for a laugh. Don't let our favorite Praxic wear you down to a nub. If she gives you grief, you give her a swift kick from me. \u2014C.Y.\n\n[Attached transcript.]\n\n\n\nRECORD: 30.10.15.C.Y.Report\nIDENTITIES: Advisor Taurun [A.T.], Empress Caiatl [E.C.], The Spider [T.S.]\nFILE//HID_CLASSIFIED//AUDIO\n\n[A.T.] The connection is made. Let the imperial record show that, on this day, the great Empress Caiatl, ascendant of Calus, slayer of Umun'arath, convened via radio message with the Spider of the Tangled Shore, formerly of the House of\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Enough, Taurun. The scribes can add whatever flourishes they wish after the fact.\n\n[T.S.] Yes, let's not waste time. I know you have more important matters to attend to. Matters that I would be happy to help with\u2026 in my own small way.\n\n[E.C.] I would no sooner seek aid from you than a war beast would from a bog-tick. Do you know how many thieves I've had to excise from my ranks? They debased themselves. Crawling about our proving grounds. Refashioning battle-trash into weapons. All because you tempted them with a flash of Glimmer.\n\n[T.S.] Ha! Me? Tempt them? It's all I can do to keep them from flooding the market.\n\n[E.C.] This is not my first time dealing with war profiteers, insect. Though, if I squash you thoroughly enough, it may be my last.\n\n[T.S.] And here I thought I was doing you a charity, promoting Cabal entrepreneurship. I was told the empire was low on funds.\n\n[E.C.] Is that so?\n\n[T.S.] Your Majesty, I don't know what advice you've been getting from your imperial hangers-on, but\u2014\n\n[A.T.] How dare you\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Quiet.\n\n[T.S.] But things are different here in the Sol system. Smash and conquer\u2014like so many traditions of old Torobatl\u2014won't get you far. Ghaul found that out the hard way. The remnants of his Red Legion have learned to adapt.\n\n[T.S.] Let me know if you'd like to do the same. I'd even go against my own custom and consider a payment plan.\n\n[E.C.] How generous. But it seems I have no need. As you've revealed, I have untapped resources at my disposal.\n\n[T.S.] Whichever ones have survived your purge, yes. But weapons are not my most valuable wares, not by a long shot. If you're anything like your father, you'll be far more interested in the information I have to offer.\n\n[E.C.] Send your coordinates. We can discuss face-to-face. But tread lightly. I've yet to decide whether you're worth my mercy.\n\n[T.S.] Oh, I'm honored to host Her Imperial Highness on my humble Shore. It's no palatial estate, but we insects are just happy to have a place to call home.\n\n[End transmission.]",
