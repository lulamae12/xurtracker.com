The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Beneath his robes, something erupts in a frenzy of motion. He pauses to compose himself and then walks on, trailing careless spatters of black fluid.\n\nBefore\u2026\n\nOsiris watches the Crucible match unfold. He does not cheer for either opponent. When a Ghost appears to revive the defeated warrior, Osiris leans forward in careful study. When Saint places a hand on his forearm, Osiris holds impossibly still just to see what the other man will do.\n\nBefore\u2026\n\nOsiris sits by the campfire as Crow and the Guardian share a drink.

The High Celebrant howls in the catacombs, and he hears his sister's voice buried in its roar. He feels his heart beating in his chest and is so enraptured by the sensation that he forgets to be frightened.\n\nBefore\u2026\n\nSavath\u00fbn, physical form a twisting instar, emerges from the shadows and crawls over the shattered pieces of the Ghost. She reaches toward the ruined man. \n\nBefore\u2026\n\nSavath\u00fbn squeezes through the calcified channels of ascendant energy and manifests within the dangling Ahamkara skull. \n\nThe man standing below the netting senses her appearance. His Light flares as he draws his weapon with impossible speed.\n\nShe has only a moment: She pushes her face down through the ropes, opens her mouth, and sings. \n\nThe man stops, then slowly holsters his weapon. He turns, crosses his arms, and forgets. \n\nShe melts awkwardly back into the skull as best she can, though a tangle of spindly elbows, licorice-black, still juts from its sockets. She turns her attention to her quarry across the gap and hums her song softly to mask herself. \n\nSoon, the man below begins to hum along with her.\n\nShe smiles.",

And you know better than to return to me empty-handed. At least I thought you knew.\" Spider narrowed his eyes at his trembling Associate. \n\n\"I do, the Spider. I\u2026 I have information, but not about Darkness. I saw the Crow. Tailing the Golem and his crew.\" \n\n\"The Vanguard has him sniffing around Basilius, hm? So we do have something to trade with the empress after all. Not that it'll do her any good; my little bird  is devilishly hard to catch.\" Spider leaned forward. \"Now HE would've gotten me something useful from Europa. You might've learned from him.\" \n\n\"Yes, the Spider.\" Arrha nodded vigorously. The faint sounds of revelry drifted in from down the hall, where the other Associates were enjoying their week's earnings. \n\n\"Avrok already told me about Crow's new assignment as Vanguard agent. Apparently, he's placed quite the wager on one of the Cabal's silly Rites ,\" the Spider chuckled. \"Avrok should've dared him to bet his freedom. Could stand to win my whole trove, he's that valuable.\" \n\n\"Yes, the Spider,\" Arrha repeated. Out of corner of his eye, he could see his share of Ether waiting in the corner. \n\n\"Oh, take your wages and go. I ought to dock you for bringing me nothing, but I'm feeling generous this week.\" Spider's voice dropped into a growl. \"Remember that I am good to you, Arrha.\" \n\nArrha nodded as he scrambled to grab his Ether tanks and get out. Finally alone, the Spider sat back in his throne. \n\n\"It's Crow, really, that needs the reminder,\" he mused aloud. \"I wonder how I might give it to him?\"",

If anything, it's good for a laugh. Don't let our favorite Praxic wear you down to a nub. If she gives you grief, you give her a swift kick from me. \u2014C.Y.\n\n[Attached transcript.]\n\n\n\nRECORD: 30.10.15.C.Y.Report\nIDENTITIES: Advisor Taurun [A.T.], Empress Caiatl [E.C.], The Spider [T.S.]\nFILE//HID_CLASSIFIED//AUDIO\n\n[A.T.] The connection is made. Let the imperial record show that, on this day, the great Empress Caiatl, ascendant of Calus, slayer of Umun'arath, convened via radio message with the Spider of the Tangled Shore, formerly of the House of\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Enough, Taurun. The scribes can add whatever flourishes they wish after the fact.\n\n[T.S.] Yes, let's not waste time. I know you have more important matters to attend to. Matters that I would be happy to help with\u2026 in my own small way.\n\n[E.C.] I would no sooner seek aid from you than a war beast would from a bog-tick. Do you know how many thieves I've had to excise from my ranks? They debased themselves. Crawling about our proving grounds. Refashioning battle-trash into weapons. All because you tempted them with a flash of Glimmer.\n\n[T.S.] Ha! Me? Tempt them? It's all I can do to keep them from flooding the market.\n\n[E.C.] This is not my first time dealing with war profiteers, insect. Though, if I squash you thoroughly enough, it may be my last.\n\n[T.S.] And here I thought I was doing you a charity, promoting Cabal entrepreneurship. I was told the empire was low on funds.\n\n[E.C.] Is that so?\n\n[T.S.] Your Majesty, I don't know what advice you've been getting from your imperial hangers-on, but\u2014\n\n[A.T.] How dare you\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Quiet.\n\n[T.S.] But things are different here in the Sol system. Smash and conquer\u2014like so many traditions of old Torobatl\u2014won't get you far. Ghaul found that out the hard way. The remnants of his Red Legion have learned to adapt.\n\n[T.S.] Let me know if you'd like to do the same. I'd even go against my own custom and consider a payment plan.\n\n[E.C.] How generous. But it seems I have no need. As you've revealed, I have untapped resources at my disposal.\n\n[T.S.] Whichever ones have survived your purge, yes. But weapons are not my most valuable wares, not by a long shot. If you're anything like your father, you'll be far more interested in the information I have to offer.\n\n[E.C.] Send your coordinates. We can discuss face-to-face. But tread lightly. I've yet to decide whether you're worth my mercy.\n\n[T.S.] Oh, I'm honored to host Her Imperial Highness on my humble Shore. It's no palatial estate, but we insects are just happy to have a place to call home.\n\n[End transmission.]",
