The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Zavala had expected the silence that followed to be equally familiar, even companionable.  \n\nThe truth was apparent in the abrasive passage of each minute. The faint sense memory of ozone in his nostrils. The gulf between them had merely shifted in quality: deep, not wide.  \n\nZavala set the datapad aside. \"Sloane. There's one more item of business.\"  \n\nShe turned to face him, ever dutiful. \"Sir?\" \n\n\"It's been a day for reunions, hasn't it?\" He nodded to Targe.  \n\nA parcel materialized into Zavala's hands in a burst of Light and transmat energy. It was heavy, wrapped carefully in cloth and secured with buckled straps that Zavala made short work of. \n\nSloane stared. \"Thought it'd be collecting dust on somebody's wall by now.\"  \n\n\"A mutual friend felt very strongly that it belonged in your hands.\"  \n\nSloane hesitated. Her expression hardened; she reached out to grip the handle of the blade, and hefted Crown-Splitter aloft with ease.  \n\nSloane smiled.  \n\n\"Feels like it never left.\"",

Dim and exhausted Motes lie scattered throughout the Derelict, slowly evaporating. She retrieves a Mote from the floor and shines her burning light over the cracked surface. The light struggles to leave the cracks. She lets the disintegrating Mote drop and shatter into dust against the floor grates. It chimes like resonate glass.\n\nThe Drifter whirls around to face the noise, almost losing his footing. He lets his hand slide off his holstered Trust as recognition washes over him. \"Ain't anybody ever tell you not to skulk? It's rude.\"\n\n\"Noted. Are you vacating?\"\n\n\"Road trip. How'd you get in here anyway?\"\n\n\"The airlock was open.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"If I said I were here to run in your rat race, would it change your tune?\"\n\n\"Uh huh\u2026\"\n\nEris drops her shoulders and approaches the Drifter. \"I want your help.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\" His brow furrows with suspicion. \"Why? Didn't you save the universe yet?\" Drifter turns back to shoving bags in bags.\n\n\"It seems to be continually in peril. To be honest, I'm not sure I've helped.\"\n\nEris hands him a bag. \"I need your knowledge.\"\n\n\"You? No.\"\n\n\"I have had some troubling experiences as of late.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's called life.\"\n\n\"I need to know,\" she says and hesitates, half-hearted restraint preceding sacrilege. \"Tell me how to interpret the Darkness.\"\n\n\"What am I, some crusty woo-woo sage? Beat it, kid. I'm packing.\"\n\n\"Do not ignore me,\" Eris says. Her voice is calm and piercing. \"We've both seen beneath the surface.\"\n\nDrifter drops the pack in his hand and picks a jade coin off his workbench.\n\n\"Asher is entrenched in his thinking,\" she says and gently places a palm down on the workbench beside them. \"Ikora\u2026 she tries. She hears, but she doesn't understand. No one is listening.\"\n\nDrifter pockets the coin and turns to face her. He stares deep. \"Experience. Hell of a thing.\" He looks down the gangway of the Derelict and through the gate that would take him to his Haul. \"Favors ain't free. I do this, you owe me.\"\n\nEris nods. Drifter swipes the workbench clean and pulls out a retractable seat for himself.\n\n\"How long you got?\"\n\nThe two sit. They speak. They listen. Linkages forged in Light and Dark of traded secrets as the Derelict hangs in orbit around the Earth. Pacts are made. Soon, there is only the silence of knowing left between them.\n\n\"Next time you fly over the Moon, dust your boots. Tracking that crap all over my floors.\"\n\nEris shakes her head and moves toward the airlock.\n\nDrifter yells after her, \"AND CALL NEXT TIME! I could've blown those fancy eyes straight out of your face.\"\n\n\"I'll try to be more mindful of your many eccentricities in the future.\"",

That didn't mean anything\u2014they could turn invisible. Everyone knew that.

He squinted as a ripple rolled high overhead, and the grid seemed to move closer, like an enormous sheet settling over the City.\n\nA wave of pressure pushed down, building in his sinuses. He pressed a hand to his eyes. A deep thrum filled his head, and he heard their claws on the walls all around him, their hissing laughter.\n\nHe turned toward the street, weapon raised. He felt his heart thudding in his chest and sweat beading on his back.\n\nAnother noise: someone pounding on glass behind him.\n\nHe spun and one of them was in his house, looking out at him through the window. His sweaty fingers fumbled to turn the safety off as it opened its mouth\u2014\n\n\"Dad,\" the Fallen shouted, \"you're standing in the garden!\"\n\nHe looked down dumbly. Cherry tomatoes were crushed beneath his bare feet.\n\nHis son yelled again, no longer a Fallen, merely irritated and half asleep. \"Come back inside!\"\n\nHands shaking, he stepped out of the garden.
