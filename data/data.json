Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here.

He was one of the oldest, and the only male Techeun I ever met. I never felt like he gave me an honest chance.\" Petra paused to consider. \"Maybe he'd already looked in the future and saw that I'd washed out.\" \n\n\"I didn't know exactly how unsuited I was until my sister started her training,\" Petra continued. \"Right away, Pinar and I began having long conversations inside our dreams. We'd talk all night and wake up with full memories of what we'd said. That was the first time I realized how powerful she'd become.\" \n\nPetra lowered her eyes. \"Of course, Pinar was Imar's favorite. And the more quickly she progressed, the stronger our shared dreams became. It didn't take long before it was more than just talking.\" \n\n\"She began to manipulate the dreams\u2014changing locations or her shape. I couldn't keep up. It was like being a passenger in my own head. Her dreams became my nightmares.\" Petra shook her head, as if dislodging an unwelcome memory. \"That's when I quit the training and the dreams stopped.\" \n\n\"Eventually I found my place in the Corsairs,\" Petra mused, \"but part of me wishes I had finished my training as a Techeun. If I had, maybe I could still find Pinar out there, in a dream somewhere.\" She plucked a blade of grass from between the paving stones and tossed it into the breeze. \n\nAfter a pensive moment, Petra focused again on Ylaia. \"So, my suggestion is to give the training a chance. If it takes, you'll know. And if not,\" she patted the grenade launcher at her side, \"we've got plenty of other jobs for you.\"",

Captain Hennek, you still with us?\n\nCC03: Reading you loud and clear, Guardian! What's the plan? Those Cabal cruisers are right behind us!\n\nHG01: I'm sending you new coordinates!

Green blinking light means power.\n\nUNK1: This ship will never fly again, Human. What value is there in a flight recorder?\n\nHG01: You never write a journal before?\n\nUNK1: I have. But I fail to see the value.\n\nHG01: Well my options here are to talk to you\u2014and no offense, but you Reefborn are an acquired taste\u2014or talk to that one, and I don't speak Fallen.\n\nUNK2: [untranslated]\n\nHG01: You see what I mean?\n\nUNK1: So you would rather\u2026 talk to yourself.\n\nHG01: Now you got it. C'mon, help me disconnect the primary power coupli\u2014\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-238\n\nHG01: Been trying to figure out how to word this. Don't know if I'll ever make it back to Earth. The thought of not saying goodbye to you keeps eating away at me.\n\nHG01: I don't know if you're safe. Don't know if you made it out of the City. \n\nHG01: Comms are down, Cabal control the channels. Been trying to get the Awoken to help, but after the whoopin' Oryx gave them, they're reluctant to get between us and the Cabal.\n\nHG01: I miss you so damn much.\n\nHG01: If we see each other again, none of this will matter. I'll complain about Reef cuisine, you'll criticize all my tactical choices, and I'll fall asleep in your arms\u2026 None of this'll matter.\n\nHG01: But in case it does, I just\u2014I want you to know I love you. That, even out here beyond the light, I never forgot you.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-239\n\nHG01: We got the old Dead Orbit ship set up as a shelter. Atmospheric controls are still working, heat, radiation shielding seems good. The friendly Fallen out here are real helpful. I thought they were slaves of the Awoken at first, but it's\u2026 not like that at all.\n\nHG01: Captain Hennek finally succumbed to his injuries. I was with him when he went.

Should translate their speech back to me in something I can understand, and then I can run it through the vocal processing heuristics onboard my jumpship to speak back.\n\nHG01: Faster than learning a language I don't have the mouth parts to speak.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-243\n\nHG01: Today was our anniversary.

But if I don't, and I live\u2026 Being here has opened my eyes to a lot of things and I just\u2014I can't fight like this anymore. Not without you. There's an enclave out past the Jovians; pacifists. You'll find me there.\n\nHG01: Kesk will have my Sidearm. I told him to give it to you if you come looking for me. Or\u2026 if he finds out you're\u2014gone\u2014to send it to the Vanguard.\n\nHG01: I won't need it anymore.\n\nHG01: All I need is you.\n\n// End Logs",

As Sok'tol strained to sit up, something slammed him down, pounding his chitinous skull into the stone again and again. He screeched as the bony frill surrounding his face splintered and snapped loose. He felt his jaw dislodge, felt his own teeth crush against his face, felt himself crack and shatter.\n\nBlackness. And then\u2014\n\nAGAIN.\n\nAs his shell knit and restored soulfire flowed anew, Sok'tol, Fifth of the Light, shuddered awake. \n\nThe Acolytes roared again. They crowded the altar, surrounded by a haze of green. Sok'tol peered upward at the Ogre pinning him against the altar. \n\nIt tightened its grip on his shoulders, claws crackling with wrathful energy. It shook its massive head, crowned in an emerald corona, and bellowed in a voice that was not its own:\n\nYOUR STRENGTH BECOMES MINE. AS WILL HERS. SPEAK.\n\nSok'tol concentrated the Light in his armored hand and began to form a grenade, but the shrieking Acolytes reached forward and tore his fingers apart in their claws. \n\nSok'tol bared his teeth and hissed up at the Ogre, whose eyes rolled with fury as a blast of soulfire erupted from its mouth. Sok'tol opened his jaws to howl as he was obliterated.\n\nBlackness. And then\u2014\n\nAGAIN.",

Determined, he rose into the air, but the Hive Knight was already charging across the Trostland cobblestones.\n\nA sudden explosion of Void energy took the Knight by surprise, but it dodged the pulsing shockwaves of a Vortex Grenade.

Delicate wisps of energy began to rise from the soil.\n\n\"That's not gonna help!\" Bask whirred angrily.\n\nThe Warlock stood, sheltering Bask with her body as he resumed his focus on Jolur. The Knight screeched and resumed fire. A volley of Shredder bolts doubled the Warlock over, but the energy seeping from the rift gave her the strength to keep standing. \n\n\"Thanks,\" said Bask sheepishly.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" she said, gritting her teeth through the gunfire. \n\nA blinding burst of energy surged as Jolur rose to his feet, body shimmering with Light. He braced himself and lobbed an orb of unstable energy that reduced the Knight to howling ash on impact. \n\n\"Appreciate the assist,\" Jolur said to Bask and the Warlock as he brushed dirt from his decrepit boots. \"These guys are stronger than I thought, but it's nothing a Nova Bomb can't handle.\"\n\nThe Warlock inspected the damage to her robe. \"What's going on with these Hive?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Jolur said. \"Lord Saladin sent a group of us down to figure out\u2014\"\n\nAnother blinding burst of energy surged nearby.

He leaned forward in his chair, his elbows on his knees, hands clasped before him.

Determined, he rose into the air, but the Hive Knight was already charging across the Trostland cobblestones.\n\nA sudden explosion of Void energy took the Knight by surprise, but it dodged the pulsing shockwaves of a Vortex Grenade. A tall Warlock in a worn green robe loped from the treeline and slid to a stop before Bask. She hastily formed a ball of Light in her palm and slammed it into the ground. Delicate wisps of energy began to rise from the soil.\n\n\"That's not gonna help!\" Bask whirred angrily.\n\nThe Warlock stood, sheltering Bask with her body as he resumed his focus on Jolur. The Knight screeched and resumed fire. A volley of Shredder bolts doubled the Warlock over, but the energy seeping from the rift gave her the strength to keep standing. \n\n\"Thanks,\" said Bask sheepishly.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" she said, gritting her teeth through the gunfire. \n\nA blinding burst of energy surged as Jolur rose to his feet, body shimmering with Light. He braced himself and lobbed an orb of unstable energy that reduced the Knight to howling ash on impact. \n\n\"Appreciate the assist,\" Jolur said to Bask and the Warlock as he brushed dirt from his decrepit boots. \"These guys are stronger than I thought, but it's nothing a Nova Bomb can't handle.\"\n\nThe Warlock inspected the damage to her robe. \"What's going on with these Hive?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Jolur said. \"Lord Saladin sent a group of us down to figure out\u2014\"\n\nAnother blinding burst of energy surged nearby.

Crow pretended not to notice and kept walking through the woods. He's been in a mood all day, Glint thought with a static sigh. He could use some time alone.\n\nWhen he reached the Hive, Glint resisted the absurd reflex to scan it for compatibility. Instead, he simply assessed, noting the strong arms that could handle the recoil from heavy weapons; the thick shell, built to absorb all manner of firepower; the remains of a bony shield that sizzled nearby, powerful enough to protect\u2014\n\nThe space next to Glint fluctuated as a bone-white Hive Ghost appeared. \n\nThe two froze warily in midair.\n\n\"Hey,\" the Hive Ghost whispered after a moment. \"It's okay.\" Its voice was surprisingly soft. \n\nIts green eye flickered reassuringly and it began to focus Light.\n\nGlint bobbed unsteadily. Crow was fifty yards off, moving carefully through the trees. \"You shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\"It'll be all right,\" it said and hovered lower to the ground, pouring Light into the fallen Hive. The surrounding ferns trembled with the sudden flow of energy.\n\n\"Wait,\" Glint pressed. But the Ghost ignored him as the thick armor of the Hive began to reform. \n\n\"Crow!\" Glint screamed, \"Crow, here!\" And he flew to him without turning back.",

An enormous feathered mantle was mounted carefully on a wooden stand and crowned with a birdlike cowl.\n\nThe hulking form of Saint-14 sat in a wooden chair facing the bed where, impossibly small beneath the blankets, rested the man known as Osiris.\n\nMithrax rapped politely on the doorframe.\n\n\"My friend,\" Saint-14 said. \"It is good of you to come.\"\n\nMithrax approached Saint and bowed. \"It is an honor to be invited,\" he said. \"These visits are pleasant to me.\" \n\nHe held out the covered dish he was carrying in his lower arms, but Saint's eyes remained fixed on Osiris. \n\nThe Titan took a ragged breath. His voice was a hoarse whisper: \"Could the Psion machine\u2026 connect my mind with his? So that I might share his dreams?\"\n\nMithrax felt useless. He spoke softly: \"The Psion tells me the subject must have residual activity for a reading, and Osiris has been asleep very long. Besides, the connection you seek joins the Light of one being to the Light of another, and Osiris is\u2014\"\n\n\"Lightless, yes,\" Saint finished flatly. He leaned forward in his chair, his elbows on his knees, hands clasped before him. He was silent for some time.\n\n\"I will let him sleep alone,\" Saint finally said, and caressed Osiris's hand with impossible tenderness. \"When he wakes, we will dream together once more.\"\n\nHe adjusted the blankets, stood, and nodded toward the covered dish Mithrax still clutched awkwardly.\n\n\"I am hoping that is not more eggplant,\" he said.\n\nMithrax coughed on his Ether. \"The eggplant is most nourishing,\" he protested weakly, and Saint groaned.",

The Ghost began to focus his Light when incoming fire sent him spinning to the ground.\n\n\"What did I tell you about dying in the open?\" the little Ghost cried in frustration. Determined, he rose into the air, but the Hive Knight was already charging across the Trostland cobblestones.\n\nA sudden explosion of Void energy took the Knight by surprise, but it dodged the pulsing shockwaves of a Vortex Grenade. A tall Warlock in a worn green robe loped from the treeline and slid to a stop before Bask. She hastily formed a ball of Light in her palm and slammed it into the ground. Delicate wisps of energy began to rise from the soil.\n\n\"That's not gonna help!\" Bask whirred angrily.\n\nThe Warlock stood, sheltering Bask with her body as he resumed his focus on Jolur. The Knight screeched and resumed fire. A volley of Shredder bolts doubled the Warlock over, but the energy seeping from the rift gave her the strength to keep standing. \n\n\"Thanks,\" said Bask sheepishly.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" she said, gritting her teeth through the gunfire. \n\nA blinding burst of energy surged as Jolur rose to his feet, body shimmering with Light. He braced himself and lobbed an orb of unstable energy that reduced the Knight to howling ash on impact. \n\n\"Appreciate the assist,\" Jolur said to Bask and the Warlock as he brushed dirt from his decrepit boots. \"These guys are stronger than I thought, but it's nothing a Nova Bomb can't handle.\"\n\nThe Warlock inspected the damage to her robe. \"What's going on with these Hive?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Jolur said. \"Lord Saladin sent a group of us down to figure out\u2014\"\n\nAnother blinding burst of energy surged nearby. The Knight rose to its feet, body shimmering with Light. \n\nThe Guardians stood frozen in horror. \n\n\"Since when can they do that?\" Bask squeaked, and the fight began in earnest.",
