The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

After Empress Caiatl's announcement, every Legionnaire in the land tank had come to jealously salute him for his promotion. It was the appointment of a lifetime. \n\nDeep within the Halphas Electus, Ignovun oversaw his arena's preparation. There was the hanging of Caiatl's banners, the anointing of his ammunition, and the intonement of the Litany of the Chosen by an imperial mythkeeper. He was fitted for new armor that gleamed in the light. He was briefed on the protocols of the Rite, and the expectations of his victory. \n\nBut now, alone in the arena, doubt creeps into Ignovun's thoughts. Ghaul believed that the strength of the smallmen was their Light. He reasoned that the power of the Traveler, like any weapon, could be stripped from the enemy and used against them. Clearly, he was wrong. \n\nIgnovun believes differently. Their strength comes not from Light, but from death. The Guardians are already walking corpses, and yet they fight on. They have all died a thousand times, while Ignovun has yet to die even once. How can he defeat an opponent whom death cannot best? \n\nSuddenly, the treacherous ravings of Ixel, the Far-Reaching did not seem so absurd. If the Cabal are to triumph over the smallmen, they will have to succeed where Ghaul failed. They will have to bring mortality to the Vanguard. \n\nIgnovun knows that these musings will not save him. But he does not fear: if the smallmen can face death, then so can he.",

Steel crumbles, slowly, to the howling blind; sleet swarms like locusts pecking rust on skeletal decay. A patient war. Inevitable, like entropy.\n\nThe storm halts as if detecting a predator on the wind\u2014quiet settles in the moment. A cloaked Vandal stands, and the silhouette of their camouflage breaks against the stillness. \n\nA cloudburst splits the sky, turning the storm and sleet to a surge of needling rain that perforates the Vandal. Soulfire rifts tear open to expel three gargantuan Hive Tomb Ships. They slowly drift into formation, unthreatened, positioning themselves above Riis-Reborn.\n\nFrom their hulls spew runes of black fire that meet between the ships and ignite into the projection of a bladed terrace, casting House Salvation's new home in shadow. \n\nIt is as night. The distant light of the Sun is choked from the sky.\n\nA voice booms like thunder. \n\nHEAR THE DIN OF RAPTURE. WELCOME ME IN YOUR ARMS. CELEBRATE MY ARRIVAL, AND KNOW ME AGAIN. FOR THIS WORLD HAS ALWAYS BEEN MINE.\n\nDeep within Bray Exoscience Creation, Clovis Bray I rouses from infernal calculous; a maintenance coordination AI has signaled an emergency.\n\n\"What is it?\" Clovis demands.\n\nA monotone version of his own voice responds. \"Unknown craft have entered Europan airspace. How shall I respond?\"\n\n\"Broadcast my voice\u2026 and arm the perimeter,\" Clovis orders.\n\n\"Affirmative. Ready upon speaking,\" the AI informs.\n\n\"Alien vessel, this is Clovis Bray. Identify yourself or be destroyed.\"\n\nThe thunder, distant, though no quieter, responds\u2026\n\n\"I AM WAR.\"",

He sees Uldren.\"\n\n\"I know,\" says Mara. Because of course she knows. She feels Crow's suffering as intensely as she feels the beating of his heart.\n\n\"You want to go to him,\" Petra states plainly. \"You shouldn't.\" Something steely has entered her voice; Mara recognizes it as a warning.\n\n\"I know that too.\" Mara turns back to the twinkling ocean of stars but focuses on the vast nothingness beyond it. \"Good night, Petra.\"\n\n\"Good night, my queen.\" Petra's retreating footsteps fade away, and Mara is alone again. \n\nNo, she thinks, not alone. She and her brother are together, even when they are apart. That is enough.\n\nIt must be.",

Why didn't you chase them down?\"\n\nBrivi kneels in front of Spider, all four of his palms on the ground. \"Their Pikes remained. They are outside. Just the crew was gone. And the crates.\" He does his best to appear compliant by tamping down his quills. \n\n\"Gone. In the middle of the Reef. On foot. With over a million Glimmer in weapons. Something about this doesn't add up.\" Spider motions to Avrok and Ahrrha, who advance on Brivi with Molten Welders raised. \"But we'll get to the truth of things soon enough.\" \n\nBrivi begins to panic. \"Please, Baron Spider. If it were not truth, I would not come back.\" Avrok prepares to melt off one of Brivi's upper arms, and looks to the Spider for the order. \n\nBefore Spider can speak, Crow steps forward from the wings. \"If I may, my Baron\u2026\" \n\nSpider gestures for Avrok to hold, and turns his attention to the Lightbearer. \"What is it? If you don't have the stomach for my discipline, you have permission to leave the room.\" \n\n\"It's not that, Baron. It's just that Brivi's account is consistent with several other instances Glint and I have seen out on the Reef. We think it has something to do with those Hive constructs.\" Crow spares a sympathetic glance toward the prostrate Brivi. \"Besides, what Brivi says is true. If he were in on the theft, he wouldn't have come back. If you'll just allow Glint and me to retrace his steps, we may find out what happened to the road crew. Who knows\u2026 we may even retrieve the weapons.\" \n\nSpider relaxes in his throne. \"Very well, Crow. Go find my weapons. And if you locate the road crew, you know what to do.\" \n\n\"Yes, Baron.\" Crow turn on a heel and strides from the room. \n\nBehind him, he hears the Spider growl, \"Avork, you may proceed.\"",
