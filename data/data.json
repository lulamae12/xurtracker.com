The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

It chimes like resonate glass.\n\nThe Drifter whirls around to face the noise, almost losing his footing. He lets his hand slide off his holstered Trust as recognition washes over him. \"Ain't anybody ever tell you not to skulk? It's rude.\"\n\n\"Noted. Are you vacating?\"\n\n\"Road trip. How'd you get in here anyway?\"\n\n\"The airlock was open.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"If I said I were here to run in your rat race, would it change your tune?\"\n\n\"Uh huh\u2026\"\n\nEris drops her shoulders and approaches the Drifter. \"I want your help.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\" His brow furrows with suspicion. \"Why? Didn't you save the universe yet?\" Drifter turns back to shoving bags in bags.\n\n\"It seems to be continually in peril. To be honest, I'm not sure I've helped.\"\n\nEris hands him a bag. \"I need your knowledge.\"\n\n\"You? No.\"\n\n\"I have had some troubling experiences as of late.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's called life.\"\n\n\"I need to know,\" she says and hesitates, half-hearted restraint preceding sacrilege. \"Tell me how to interpret the Darkness.\"\n\n\"What am I, some crusty woo-woo sage? Beat it, kid. I'm packing.\"\n\n\"Do not ignore me,\" Eris says. Her voice is calm and piercing. \"We've both seen beneath the surface.\"\n\nDrifter drops the pack in his hand and picks a jade coin off his workbench.\n\n\"Asher is entrenched in his thinking,\" she says and gently places a palm down on the workbench beside them. \"Ikora\u2026 she tries. She hears, but she doesn't understand. No one is listening.\"\n\nDrifter pockets the coin and turns to face her. He stares deep. \"Experience. Hell of a thing.\" He looks down the gangway of the Derelict and through the gate that would take him to his Haul. \"Favors ain't free. I do this, you owe me.\"\n\nEris nods. Drifter swipes the workbench clean and pulls out a retractable seat for himself.\n\n\"How long you got?\"\n\nThe two sit. They speak. They listen. Linkages forged in Light and Dark of traded secrets as the Derelict hangs in orbit around the Earth. Pacts are made. Soon, there is only the silence of knowing left between them.\n\n\"Next time you fly over the Moon, dust your boots. Tracking that crap all over my floors.\"\n\nEris shakes her head and moves toward the airlock.\n\nDrifter yells after her, \"AND CALL NEXT TIME! I could've blown those fancy eyes straight out of your face.\"\n\n\"I'll try to be more mindful of your many eccentricities in the future.\"",

If anything, it's good for a laugh. Don't let our favorite Praxic wear you down to a nub. If she gives you grief, you give her a swift kick from me. \u2014C.Y.\n\n[Attached transcript.]\n\n\n\nRECORD: 30.10.15.C.Y.Report\nIDENTITIES: Advisor Taurun [A.T.], Empress Caiatl [E.C.], The Spider [T.S.]\nFILE//HID_CLASSIFIED//AUDIO\n\n[A.T.] The connection is made. Let the imperial record show that, on this day, the great Empress Caiatl, ascendant of Calus, slayer of Umun'arath, convened via radio message with the Spider of the Tangled Shore, formerly of the House of\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Enough, Taurun. The scribes can add whatever flourishes they wish after the fact.\n\n[T.S.] Yes, let's not waste time. I know you have more important matters to attend to. Matters that I would be happy to help with\u2026 in my own small way.\n\n[E.C.] I would no sooner seek aid from you than a war beast would from a bog-tick. Do you know how many thieves I've had to excise from my ranks? They debased themselves. Crawling about our proving grounds. Refashioning battle-trash into weapons. All because you tempted them with a flash of Glimmer.\n\n[T.S.] Ha! Me? Tempt them? It's all I can do to keep them from flooding the market.\n\n[E.C.] This is not my first time dealing with war profiteers, insect. Though, if I squash you thoroughly enough, it may be my last.\n\n[T.S.] And here I thought I was doing you a charity, promoting Cabal entrepreneurship. I was told the empire was low on funds.\n\n[E.C.] Is that so?\n\n[T.S.] Your Majesty, I don't know what advice you've been getting from your imperial hangers-on, but\u2014\n\n[A.T.] How dare you\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Quiet.\n\n[T.S.] But things are different here in the Sol system. Smash and conquer\u2014like so many traditions of old Torobatl\u2014won't get you far. Ghaul found that out the hard way. The remnants of his Red Legion have learned to adapt.\n\n[T.S.] Let me know if you'd like to do the same. I'd even go against my own custom and consider a payment plan.\n\n[E.C.] How generous. But it seems I have no need. As you've revealed, I have untapped resources at my disposal.\n\n[T.S.] Whichever ones have survived your purge, yes. But weapons are not my most valuable wares, not by a long shot. If you're anything like your father, you'll be far more interested in the information I have to offer.\n\n[E.C.] Send your coordinates. We can discuss face-to-face. But tread lightly. I've yet to decide whether you're worth my mercy.\n\n[T.S.] Oh, I'm honored to host Her Imperial Highness on my humble Shore. It's no palatial estate, but we insects are just happy to have a place to call home.\n\n[End transmission.]",

A philosophy of living, shared by all.\n\nThat is why the House of Light survived, even when we fled Europa. Even after the Shipstealer took all we had. We were bound not by place or possessions, but as family.\n\nCryptarch Matsuo asked me why the old crews are not considered Houses. It is a wise question. One that, perhaps, does not have a singular answer. \n\nI think it is because those who lead the old crews do not wish to be true Kells. A Kell is responsible for the safety and prosperity of their House. It is an honor, and a burden.\n\nThose you call Pirate Lords wish only to take\u2014they give nothing, even to their own people.

Your best bet was to be stronger than the next crew over\u2014and when things were especially bad, stronger than whoever was in the cot next to yours.\n\nSo they got strong. And remember, they didn't have Void or Solar like you do; they had claws. Blades. When they killed, it was without hesitation, and when they died, there was no coming back. \n\nYou Guardians, with your little Ghosts hovering nearby, you have the luxury of kindness\u2014that was never an option for the old crews.

In fact, I have just finished going over my notes!\n\nThe old crews rose in the wake of the Whirlwind, during what we Eliksni refer to as the Long Drift\u2014the span of time between the fall of Riis and our arrival in the Sol system. I believe the equivalent period would be your Dark Ages, though Riis did not have Risen, or Iron Lords. Instead, we had the crews. As you can imagine, this period was quite lawless, as the stability and abundance of Riis was no more. This resulted in what I believe is called a zero-sum game: a situation in which every gain or advantage is earned at the expense of another. \n\nSeveral fearsome individuals rose to great power and authoritative prominence at that time; the Eliksni word for them translates to \"Ketchkiller,\" meaning one who boards and wrests control of enemy ships. These Ketchkillers commanded great fleets and raided many supply routes, procuring objects of historic or intrinsic value along the way. It is exciting to wonder what treasures they accumulated beyond those we've recovered already!\n\nMany crews were abolished or disbanded over time, but those that survived did so through great hardship\u2014they are formidable indeed. But then, so is the Vanguard, and its Guardians.\n\nThank you for asking about my research into the old crews and their significance. It is always a pleasure to talk about it. After all, what use is knowledge if it is not shared?",

Ain't much I can tell you that you couldn't get from Rahool, but I can't blame you if you'd rather stay awake for the whole story, heheh. C'mon, loosen up, hero! If you think a grim expression is all it takes to move up through the Vanguard\u2026 well, you may have something there.\n\nOkay, I'll start at the beginning. The Traveler chose the Eliksni and everything was great over in Riis, until it wasn't. The Whirlwind happened, the Pyramids showed up, the Traveler took off through space, and from what I gather, it wasn't a pretty scene. \n\nEramis was there for it. And\u2014credit where it's due\u2014she picked herself up, grabbed a crew, and went after the Traveler. She cut through everything in her way, dead set on hunting it down. \n\nAnd she wasn't the only one with that idea. Whole fleets of ships chased the Traveler. Lawless days. Hopeless days. \n\n\u2026See, I was here for the Dark Ages. And when there's nothing but loss around you planetside, you can still find a rooftop, sit in a snowfield. You can go into a forest and find a moment of quiet\u2014a little scrap of peace.\n\nAin't like that on a ship. Things go from bad to worse, you just have to face it. And Eramis did. That takes a gutful of grit.\n\nNow, don't think I'm writin' love poems to the Shipstealer over here\u2014we find her, I'm drawing down quick as you are. \n\nBut if the big old Traveler blasted outta the sky tomorrow? You bet your entire vault we'd chase after it. We'd be the new crews, going after something we knew in our bones was ours, not stopping for anyone or anything that got in our way.\n\nAnd we'd still think of ourselves as heroes, wouldn't we?",
