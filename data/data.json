Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

My favorite\u2026\" Spider trails off with a drag of ether to select a title befitting the Drifter, \"\u2026nothing.\"\n\n\"You think this'll take?\" The Drifter says and nods skyward, kicking an empty ether canister off the side of their floating mote of Reef. Red streaks burn in the star-sea sky beyond the vast cloud of asteroids and dust, drawing the shape of a new constellation as the Warmind launches fresh guns.\n\n\"An 'almighty' effort. Splendid.\" Spider steps off a transit craft, alone. \"We could have met in\u2026 a more protected place.\"\n\n\"You don't like being seen with me?\"\n\n\"The Spider is a friend to all, but not all my friends are friends,\" Spider says and focuses his gaze on the Drifter. \"You should have come to me.\"\n\n\"You keep too many bodies around. Bodies can stab you in the back.\"\n\n\"Running shows your back,\" the Spider's voice shudders, \"to everyone.\"\n\nDrifter pauses a moment and looks around at the desolate scape. Small boulders hang in space. They slowly drift towards each other, make contact, and bounce away on random trajectories. Some stick; incorporated via destructive consummation. He scowls and turns back to Spider. \"Stretch your legs. No one here for miles.\"\n\nThe Spider unfurls himself, slurping a heavy vacuumous drag from his rebreather. Fully upright, he dwarfs the Drifter in shadow. \"Isolation\u2026 is not the same as protection, friend.\"\n\n\"Friendship gonna save us from what's coming?\" Drifter asks. He places his fingertips together, the space between his hands resembling a triangle.\n\n\"The odds aren't in your favor, but\u2026\" a guttural laugh ripples from Spider's belly and sends vibration through the loose-packed dirt underfoot, \"I'm the wrong one to come to for comfort.\"\n\n\"I get it. You tried running last time. Didn't work. Now you're trying to hide. Let me give you some advice: that don't work either.\"\n\n\"Hiding? the Spider asks and waits. \"The board changes. The board clears. I don't play, I just price the pieces.\"\n\n\"Cold-blooded. World's ending and you want a run at it for all it's got.\"\n\n\"'End' is a matter of perspective. Devastation is oftentimes,\" he says with a breath, \"profitable.\"\n\n\"What if nothing's left? Skin and bones?\"\n\n\"There's always ivory among the bones.\"\n\n\"Bull.\"\n\nSpider slings a single breathy, \"Ha.\"\n\n\"You remind me of my compatriots.\" Spider wraps his fingers around a small clod of earth drifting by. \"They looked at the Whirlwind, just like you. Scared.\" He closes his hand, crushing the clod into a dense mound. It fractures into several pieces that waft away as Spider releases his grip. \"But here we are, living on anyway.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Fallen.\"\n\n\"Fallen. I hold favor among Witches, and Kells, and whispering agents\u2026 of every shade and shape. My web is vast, and I have proven useful. Let the kings bloody each other. I'll direct the runoff.\"\n\n\"You talking about Guardians? Hate to break it to you, but they're a cheap date.\"\n\n\"Cheap is malleable. Cheap becomes\u2026 cheaper in desperation.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" The Drifter pulls a small and ornate box of Awoken design from his rucksack. \"Who you lookin' for with this anyway?\"\n\nThe Spider steps toward Drifter, smothering his personal space. \"Options, my dear rogue; tangled in the web.\" He takes the box with his dominant arms and plops two stuffed sacks of Ghost shells into the Drifter's hands with his others.\n\n\"Went through hell to get that little box. Don't come with no throne,\" Drifter says, holding his voice steady, jaw tense to stay the trembling.\n\nThe Spider chitters as a shiver runs through him. \"No. Just a looking-glass window. Good business, friend.\" The hulking Fallen Don turns to leave. \"Remember\u2026 remain useful.\"\n\n\"When you find 'em, you sure the past won't come knocking?\"\n\n\"No one minds the Spider.\"\n\n\"Lucky.\"",

Sola drops. \"Disgrace of a Warlock.\"\n\nSola's Ghost hangs motionless in the air beside her dead charge. A breeze rustles char from the patches of blackened grass around them. Her iris flicks next to the two Praxic watchdogs: the Warlock who pulled the trigger and the Titan partner who shakes a recent death from his bones.\n\nAunor turns to her colleague. \"Should we have her resurrected and ask again?\"\n\nThe Titan wipes blood from his chest plate as his Ghost patches his armor. A fresh bullet hole sits above his heart. \"No, I think she made herself clear the first time.\"\n\nSola's Ghost pipes up, \"Who says I would?\"\n\n\"You have nothing to fear, Little Light.

The Warmind had revealed the anomaly was moving through the outer system. But you know that, and you know how to find it.\"\n\nThe Ghost mimics a \"spit\" noise. \"Run back to your quiet Traveler. I won't be ordered around anymore!\"\n\nAunor's body deflates as she holsters her weapon. \"Bahaghari\u2026\" she says. A Ghost appears at Aunor's side. \"Prepare our tools. This one appears touched as well.\"\n\nBahaghari nods and slips away to follow the order.\n\nThe Striker Titan approaches and snaps his  fingers. A stunning bolt of lightning pelts Sola's Ghost out of the air into unconsciousness. \"It's affecting Ghosts now too. We should bring them back to the City. This makes five.\"\n\nHe picks up the Ghost and shoulders Sola's body before shuffling off to their ship.\n\nAunor turns to follow. \"Five, and counting,\" she whispers to herself without taking her eyes off Sola's Ghost.",

Just his speed. \n\nConstruction Redjacks had pulled the pistol from the build site of the H.E.L.M. Some of their deeper combat coding must have kicked in, because they brought the piece to him directly. Banshee wondered how long this beauty had been stuck in the rubble. Hell, maybe it was buried there intentionally. Evidence of some evil deed from way back. \n\nWell, any dirt on this hardware was long forgotten by now. Banshee set to disassembling the gun, his hands working faster than the eye could follow. In just a few seconds, he had it in constituent parts on his bench. He scanned the surface of each component, looking for the maker's mark. \n\nThere! A tiny inscription on the trigger pin. Almost imperceptible, even to his digital eyes. He examined the pin through his loupe. The mark read \"B-44.4.C-6\". Seemed like a part number. Guess he'd never know who crafted it. \n\nIt really was a helluva piece, though. Whoever made it had a real eye for the game. \n\nWherever you came from, he thought, it's time to find you a new home.",

If anything, it's good for a laugh. Don't let our favorite Praxic wear you down to a nub. If she gives you grief, you give her a swift kick from me. \u2014C.Y.\n\n[Attached transcript.]\n\n\n\nRECORD: 30.10.15.C.Y.Report\nIDENTITIES: Advisor Taurun [A.T.], Empress Caiatl [E.C.], The Spider [T.S.]\nFILE//HID_CLASSIFIED//AUDIO\n\n[A.T.] The connection is made. Let the imperial record show that, on this day, the great Empress Caiatl, ascendant of Calus, slayer of Umun'arath, convened via radio message with the Spider of the Tangled Shore, formerly of the House of\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Enough, Taurun. The scribes can add whatever flourishes they wish after the fact.\n\n[T.S.] Yes, let's not waste time. I know you have more important matters to attend to. Matters that I would be happy to help with\u2026 in my own small way.\n\n[E.C.] I would no sooner seek aid from you than a war beast would from a bog-tick. Do you know how many thieves I've had to excise from my ranks? They debased themselves. Crawling about our proving grounds. Refashioning battle-trash into weapons. All because you tempted them with a flash of Glimmer.\n\n[T.S.] Ha! Me? Tempt them? It's all I can do to keep them from flooding the market.\n\n[E.C.] This is not my first time dealing with war profiteers, insect. Though, if I squash you thoroughly enough, it may be my last.\n\n[T.S.] And here I thought I was doing you a charity, promoting Cabal entrepreneurship. I was told the empire was low on funds.\n\n[E.C.] Is that so?\n\n[T.S.] Your Majesty, I don't know what advice you've been getting from your imperial hangers-on, but\u2014\n\n[A.T.] How dare you\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Quiet.\n\n[T.S.] But things are different here in the Sol system. Smash and conquer\u2014like so many traditions of old Torobatl\u2014won't get you far. Ghaul found that out the hard way. The remnants of his Red Legion have learned to adapt.\n\n[T.S.] Let me know if you'd like to do the same. I'd even go against my own custom and consider a payment plan.\n\n[E.C.] How generous. But it seems I have no need. As you've revealed, I have untapped resources at my disposal.\n\n[T.S.] Whichever ones have survived your purge, yes. But weapons are not my most valuable wares, not by a long shot. If you're anything like your father, you'll be far more interested in the information I have to offer.\n\n[E.C.] Send your coordinates. We can discuss face-to-face. But tread lightly. I've yet to decide whether you're worth my mercy.\n\n[T.S.] Oh, I'm honored to host Her Imperial Highness on my humble Shore. It's no palatial estate, but we insects are just happy to have a place to call home.\n\n[End transmission.]",

Every creak and groan of his throne becomes excruciatingly pronounced. Spider reclines against one arm, rolling a dead Ghost's shell in one hand, scraping a clawed finger across its gray, lifeless eye. The arrival of a trusted associate pulls Spider from his thoughts. \n\n\"Avrok,\" Spider bellows, turning his attention to the armored Eliksni striding through the doorway, \"what did you find?\" \n\nAvrok approaches Spider's throne, wringing his hands together anxiously. \"Our thief, my lord.\" \n\nSpider leans forward with a groan of the cables suspending his throne. \"And what did you do to them?\" he asks in greedy anticipation. That, however, is where Avrok falters. \n\n\"I did not\u2026 catch them, my lord,\" Avrok humbly answers, his much smaller frame eclipsed in Spider's shadow. \"But I have a name.\" \n\n\"Out with it,\" Spider grouses, falling back against his throne with deflated interest. \n\n\"The Crow.\" \n\nSpider's blood turns to fire. His grip tightens on that dead Ghost so hard its shell cracks. Spider continues squeezing it until the glass eye completely pops. \n\nThen he takes a moment to compose himself. \n\n\"Our little bird, come home to the nest so soon? Tell me everything.\" \n\n\"He was able to infiltrate the storehouse,\" Avrok explains, \"and coerced a team of laborers to offload cargo promised to the empress onto a Skiff, which he then\u2026 stole. Along with a cache of your more\u2014ah\u2014personal belongings, among which was the quantum opal.\" \n\n Avrok shrinks lower, lower, lower. \"The supplies were delivered to Mithrax. In your name. As a gift.\" \n\n\"And the workers?\" Spider growls. \n\n\"They are gone?\" Avrok doesn't mean to make it sound like a question, and regrets taking the tone immediately. \n\n\"To where, exactly?\" \n\n\"They\u2026\" Avrok takes a small step back from Spider's throne. \"Left.\" He clenches his jaws. \"With the Crow.\" \n\nSpider slowly leans forward again. \n\n\"For Earth,\" Avrok concludes. \n\nThe Ether pipes begin to hum and rattle as a new batch begins production elsewhere in the complex. The noises rise in intensity, turning into the familiar hissing wail that joins with the uncomfortable sound of Spider. Laughing. \n\nThe Baron of the Shore throws his dead Ghost at Avrok who ducks away from it, covering his head with his hands. \n\n\"He's taking them to Mithrax,\" Spider says between fitful chuckles and wheezing coughs. \"He steals\u2014from me\u2014and gives it to the House of Light? Unbelievable.\" Though behind the laughter and coughs, there is a hint of appreciation in his tone. \"The kid's grown a spine.\" \n\n\"There is,\" Avrok starts, offering Spider a folded piece of paper, \"one more thing. He left this behind.\" Spider's seal is scribbled on one side. \"For you.\" \n\nAs Spider unfolds the note, Avrok creeps further away from the throne. Inside is nothing more than a crude drawing and a rude missive. \n\n \"That little sh\u2014 \"\n\nThe pipes are howling.",

Though he had fasted during his trip, Ahrrha knew that his solid frame still made him stand out. He feared it would reveal him as the imposter and infiltrator he was, even while dressed as a House Salvation deserter.\n\nDuring the approach to Earth, Ahrrha had been overawed. The Last City looked like a perfect ripple of Light from above, dropped from the impassive form of the Great Machine. Ahrrha wondered for the first time in his life if the Spider was wrong about the Guardians.\n\nBut his misgivings evaporated as soon as he emerged from the drop ship. Rather than living in a gleaming city of crystal, the Eliksni were packed into the bombed-out ruins of a former war zone. The area they'd been \"given\" appeared to be on the verge of collapse. \n\nAhrrha sneered inwardly. Did the Guardians really believe that the Eliksni could be pacified so cheaply? That they were content to live under the boots of the Vanguard, gnawing at scraps? Perhaps it was true for fools like Misraaks, his Awoken-raised hatchling, and cowards like the Empty Weaver. \n\nBut the Spider's acquiescence would not be so easily bought. In fact, Ahrrha thought, the Spider could probably own this settlement within a year. The generosity and goodwill of House Light would soon crumble to greed and hubris, as they all did. And once Spider's syndicate had a foothold, they would make the Vanguard pay. In Glimmer, weapons, Ether, and blood.",
