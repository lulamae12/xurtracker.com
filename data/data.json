The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

His body ached from lack of Ether, but he dared not pull from his rebreather for fear of discovery. \n\nBesides, if he survived, there would be enough to sate his hunger a dozen times over.\n\nHe and Krilix had been calibrating the landing struts on the crew's Ketch when the ambush hit. A long-range scout rifle slug punched through Krilix in the opening salvo, ripping a fist-sized hole in his chest. He fell on top of Vrisk in a heap of gore as a barrage of gunfire rained down on their position. \n\nVrisk could have shrugged off the Wretch's body and seized his Arc Spear to retaliate. Instead, he simply lay beneath his dying crewmate and let the battle play out. \n\nAfter the shooting stopped, Vrisk listened to their assailants ransack the ship. A mix of guttural Cabal barks and familiar Eliksni chatter marked them as a competing crew, eager to claim the bounty set forth by the reawakened Shipstealer.\n\nBut Vrisk knew what their attackers did not: the relic they sought was not on the Ketch, or even on this planet. It was hidden in a safehouse deep within the asteroid belt beyond Mars. Once Vrisk found the courage to emerge from his hiding place, he would take the relic to Eramiskel himself and claim the reward for his own.\n\nBut there was time for that. For now, the Dreg let the weight and warmth of his dead companion press him into a peaceful slumber, where he dreamed of better days to come.",

If you don't have the stomach for my discipline, you have permission to leave the room.\" \n\n\"It's not that, Baron. It's just that Brivi's account is consistent with several other instances Glint and I have seen out on the Reef.

Who knows\u2026 we may even retrieve the weapons.\" \n\nSpider relaxes in his throne. \"Very well, Crow. Go find my weapons. And if you locate the road crew, you know what to do.\" \n\n\"Yes, Baron.\" Crow turn on a heel and strides from the room. \n\nBehind him, he hears the Spider growl, \"Avork, you may proceed.\"",

One degree off spin-north.\" Uldren squinted downrange, as if peering into the sun. Jolyon frowned. The sun was behind them.\n\nThis was the first time he and Uldren had been to the range since their return from the Black Garden, and Jolyon was shocked by how hollowed-out his friend looked. Jolyon couldn't quite put his finger on what had changed, but there was definitely something new in Uldren's eyes. Something terribly familiar.\n\n\"Sending it.\" Jolyon pulled the trigger and missed by thirty meters. That's how far the calculations had shifted during his moment of hesitation. Jolyon grimaced.\n\n\"Nice shot,\" Uldren muttered, \"you always were the best.\"\n\nJolyon didn't even bother to hide his concern. It was clear that Uldren was also plagued by the nightmares. The nocturnal visions Jolyon dared not mention aloud. The grotesque beating heart, mangled by Vex technology, slimy with overripe pulp, thorny wires reaching outward. The wet mechanical thump of the dark beating heart, the thick beating heart\u2014\n\nJolyon snapped to. He had been drifting. He looked up to find the Awoken prince squinting down at him, as if trying to spot something in the distance. Something barely visible and receding further by the day.",

You're the only thing in the universe that would drive him to such lengths.\" He could feel the queen's cold glare boring a hole through the top of his head.\n\n\"Is that meant as an excuse, Jolyon?\" the queen seethed. \"Because it sounds remarkably petty. Childish, even. The Darkness is not something to be toyed with. Who knows what you might have awakened. My decree was for our protection. As my most trusted Crow, I would have thought you understood that.\"\n\n\"Yes, my queen. I understand.\"\n\nMara Sov slowly descended from her dais, looming over her childhood friend. Her subject. \"You say you understand, yet you directly disobeyed my command to avoid that place.\"\n\nShe bent forward at the waist, until her lips were nearly brushing his ear. Her voice dropped to a whisper. \"Is this treason?\" The word echoed silently through the empty throne room. Jolyon's blood froze.\n\n\"Please, my queen, try to understand. Uldren is your kin by birth. By blood. There is nothing you wouldn't do for each other.\" He paused, choosing his next words carefully. \"He is your brother, but he's mine as well. He's saved my life more times than I can count. And not just in battle. He's saved me from despair. From self-doubt. When Laviska died, when my world was crumbling, he saved me from myself.\"\n\nAs emotion welled up within him, Jolyon found the courage to raise his head and meet the queen's lofty gaze. \"Uldren is my brother too. I love him, and I would follow him anywhere. I would follow him into death, if he asked. Just as he would for you. And if you call that treason, so be it.\"",
