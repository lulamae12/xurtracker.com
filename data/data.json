Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

After Empress Caiatl's announcement, every Legionnaire in the land tank had come to jealously salute him for his promotion. It was the appointment of a lifetime. \n\nDeep within the Halphas Electus, Ignovun oversaw his arena's preparation. There was the hanging of Caiatl's banners, the anointing of his ammunition, and the intonement of the Litany of the Chosen by an imperial mythkeeper. He was fitted for new armor that gleamed in the light. He was briefed on the protocols of the Rite, and the expectations of his victory. \n\nBut now, alone in the arena, doubt creeps into Ignovun's thoughts. Ghaul believed that the strength of the smallmen was their Light. He reasoned that the power of the Traveler, like any weapon, could be stripped from the enemy and used against them. Clearly, he was wrong. \n\nIgnovun believes differently. Their strength comes not from Light, but from death. The Guardians are already walking corpses, and yet they fight on. They have all died a thousand times, while Ignovun has yet to die even once. How can he defeat an opponent whom death cannot best? \n\nSuddenly, the treacherous ravings of Ixel, the Far-Reaching did not seem so absurd. If the Cabal are to triumph over the smallmen, they will have to succeed where Ghaul failed. They will have to bring mortality to the Vanguard. \n\nIgnovun knows that these musings will not save him. But he does not fear: if the smallmen can face death, then so can he.",

                "ExtLore": "The Eliksni awkwardly shouldered its way onto the empty stool at the ramen shop and rested its four elbows on the bar.\n\nMaurice looked up over the huge pot of broth and, thinking a Titan in one of their ridiculous helmets had arrived for lunch, called out \"Irasshaimase!\" It wasn't until he absently stepped to the bar that he realized who his customer was.\n\nMetal plating covered the creature's forehead and the side of its face, ending in a nozzle that hissed a stream of blueish mist. A haphazard collision of heavy canvas and metallic weave draped over its shoulders. A Vanguard lanyard dangled absurdly from its neck. \n\nIt was small for an Eliksni, but its angular head still towered above Maurice as it hunched over the bar. Four blue eyes looked back at him from above a lipless mouth. It opened, revealing rows of thin, sharp teeth. \n\n\"One item ramen soup,\" the Eliksni croaked stiltedly. \"Please.\" \n\nMaurice held his breath, tightened his grip on his pencil, and grinned. He grinned when he was nervous, and this seemed like as good a time as any. \n\nThe Eliksni grinned back, nodded, and then opened its horrible mouth again. \"I smelled it, and the smell was good,\" it said.\n\nMaurice scanned the bar. His other customers sat frozen, their bowls of ramen steaming silently in front of them. He realized his mouth had apparently decided to talk on its own, as if nothing were wrong. He heard himself ask, \"How spicy, zero to five stars?\"\n\nThe Eliksni had anticipated this question. \"Spicy five stars,\" it said, holding up one hand with three claws splayed, and another with two. \"May I receive additional dead flesh, please?\"\n\n\"You got it,\" Maurice said, his even voice betraying none of his tension, and he turned back to the bubbling pot of broth. Muscle memory took over, and he soon found himself placing a steaming bowl of ramen in front of the creature, who clucked cheerfully.\n\nMaurice took a half-step back. A small crowd was forming in the walkway in front of the restaurant. Some of the customers leaned in as their curiosity overcame their terror. Maurice noticed the woman in seat 2 needed more water, but it could wait. \n\nThe Eliksni raised its arms tentatively, then looked to Maurice again. \"What is the protocol?\" \n\nMaurice found himself unsure of which pair of the Eliksni's eyes to look into and focused on the ramen instead. \"Well, you eat the noodles and pork and egg with\u2014\" \n\n\"Egg,\" repeated the Eliksni, enjoying the unfamiliar word.\n\n\"\u2014yeah, egg. You eat all that with the chopsticks, and you get the broth with the spoon.\" Maurice saw how the Eliksni's claws dwarfed the ceramic spoon. \"Or you can just lift the whole bowl and drink it.\"\n\nMaurice mimed lifting a bowl to his lips. The Eliksni nodded. Its claws tapped the metal on its face and the hissing blue mist ceased. \n\nThe Eliksni held the chopsticks, tested their weight, and respectfully placed them back on the bar before bringing the bowl to its mouth with its upper arms. Above the ramen bowl, Maurice saw all four of the Eliksni's eyes close. \n\nA long moment of tension fell over the shop, the silence broken only by a staccato series of hissing slurps.\n\nFinally, the Eliksni lowered the empty bowl. It breathed in as the blue mist resumed its thin spray. It looked toward Maurice. \"I tasted all of it,\" it said with deep satisfaction. \"I am very thankful.\"\n\nMaurice's grin turned into a tentative smile. \"Glad you enjoyed it.\" \n\nThe Eliksni stood and held out what looked like a small model of the Traveler. It glowed as it floated in the Eliksni's palm. \"Compensation,\" it said.\n\nMaurice reached to take the treasure, then drew his hand back. \"For new customers, there is no charge,\" he said. \"No compensation. Thank you for coming in.\" \n\nThe Eliksni cocked its head, then clucked and the model vanished beneath the folds of its cloak. It smiled at Maurice. \n\n\"You,\" it said, then cleared its throat with a rumble, \"you are a\u2014\" and the five spirited words that followed were replete with hard consonants. \n\nIn the confused silence that followed, the Eliksni nodded graciously, then walked through the crowd outside and deeper into the City.",

Even if I didn't recognize his face, I would have put two and two together.\n\nHonestly, sometimes I even wonder if he figured it out before he spoke to Savath\u00fbn. If what she showed him just confirmed what he already suspected.\n\nThe thing is, I know a lot more about Crow than Savath\u00fbn ever did. I know the smirk on his face when he pulls off something impossible. The way he flips his knife before throwing it. Even the way he averts his eyes when someone praises him. \n\nAnd sometimes, I wonder if Uldren shared any of his traits, his habits. Maybe. It's impossible for me to say for certain. But it doesn't really matter.\n\nBecause I know that my Guardian only takes risks when they are necessary, not for the thrill of it. He celebrates others' victories, not their losses. Everything he does is for someone else's benefit. He is humble. He is kind.\n\nThat is who he really is. And it's up to me to remind him. Because Crow is my Guardian.\n\nNot Uldren.",
