Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

He feared it would reveal him as the imposter and infiltrator he was, even while dressed as a House Salvation deserter.\n\nDuring the approach to Earth, Ahrrha had been overawed. The Last City looked like a perfect ripple of Light from above, dropped from the impassive form of the Great Machine. Ahrrha wondered for the first time in his life if the Spider was wrong about the Guardians.\n\nBut his misgivings evaporated as soon as he emerged from the drop ship. Rather than living in a gleaming city of crystal, the Eliksni were packed into the bombed-out ruins of a former war zone. The area they'd been \"given\" appeared to be on the verge of collapse. \n\nAhrrha sneered inwardly. Did the Guardians really believe that the Eliksni could be pacified so cheaply? That they were content to live under the boots of the Vanguard, gnawing at scraps? Perhaps it was true for fools like Misraaks, his Awoken-raised hatchling, and cowards like the Empty Weaver. \n\nBut the Spider's acquiescence would not be so easily bought. In fact, Ahrrha thought, the Spider could probably own this settlement within a year. The generosity and goodwill of House Light would soon crumble to greed and hubris, as they all did. And once Spider's syndicate had a foothold, they would make the Vanguard pay. In Glimmer, weapons, Ether, and blood.",

Own choices, yes? Do better.\n\n@EURFOB: What is Misraakskel seeking?\n\n@BOTZA-GUEST: Perspective.\n\n@EURFOB: [insect-like chattering]\n\n@BOTZA-GUEST:  I know. I am finding myself at odds with an Exo, a leader of humanity. She does not trust our kind, and I fear what may come of her intolerance.\n\n@EURFOB: Trust is earned, yes?\n\n@BOTZA-GUEST: This is different. Blunt. Cold.\n\n@BOTZA-GUEST: She does not wish to give trust. There is no transaction. Just\u2026 anger.\n\n@EURFOB: Variks knows this. Variks also remembers Misraakskel as a soft-shelled hatchling, always mewling. Always wishing to make friends, even with the older Dregs who would push him over.\n\n@EURFOB: Misraakskel, always trying.\n\n@BOTZA-GUEST: Is peace not worth trying for?\n\n@EURFOB: With those who accept peace in their hearts? Yes.\n\n@EURFOB: Some only know war. Only want war.\n\n@EURFOB: Not all battles can be won with words.\n\n@BOTZA-GUEST: Then, what? I cannot strike at her. It would confirm all of the Humans' worst fears.\n\n@EURFOB: This is where Misraakskel and Variks differ. But perhaps\u2026 also where we are similar.\n\n@EURFOB: Do you trust any of the Humans?\n\n@BOTZA-GUEST: Yes. Some.\n\n@EURFOB: With your life?\n\n[long silence]\n\n@BOTZA-GUEST: Some.\n\n@EURFOB: There is Misraakskel's perspective.\n\n@BOTZA-GUEST: Thank you, Variks.\n\n@EURFOB: Do not thank Variks yet.
