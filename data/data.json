The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

It's not because I don't know my answer, but because I want to feel like I still doubt it. I raise my head. Gaelin meets my eyes and looks up to the canopy.\n\nHe leans his shoulder into me and drops his voice to a whisper. \"My Clip's  a good one, but you need to realize Ghosts don't know anything.

If anything, it's good for a laugh. Don't let our favorite Praxic wear you down to a nub. If she gives you grief, you give her a swift kick from me. \u2014C.Y.\n\n[Attached transcript.]\n\n\n\nRECORD: 30.10.15.C.Y.Report\nIDENTITIES: Advisor Taurun [A.T.], Empress Caiatl [E.C.], The Spider [T.S.]\nFILE//HID_CLASSIFIED//AUDIO\n\n[A.T.] The connection is made. Let the imperial record show that, on this day, the great Empress Caiatl, ascendant of Calus, slayer of Umun'arath, convened via radio message with the Spider of the Tangled Shore, formerly of the House of\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Enough, Taurun. The scribes can add whatever flourishes they wish after the fact.\n\n[T.S.] Yes, let's not waste time. I know you have more important matters to attend to. Matters that I would be happy to help with\u2026 in my own small way.\n\n[E.C.] I would no sooner seek aid from you than a war beast would from a bog-tick. Do you know how many thieves I've had to excise from my ranks? They debased themselves. Crawling about our proving grounds. Refashioning battle-trash into weapons. All because you tempted them with a flash of Glimmer.\n\n[T.S.] Ha! Me? Tempt them? It's all I can do to keep them from flooding the market.\n\n[E.C.] This is not my first time dealing with war profiteers, insect. Though, if I squash you thoroughly enough, it may be my last.\n\n[T.S.] And here I thought I was doing you a charity, promoting Cabal entrepreneurship. I was told the empire was low on funds.\n\n[E.C.] Is that so?\n\n[T.S.] Your Majesty, I don't know what advice you've been getting from your imperial hangers-on, but\u2014\n\n[A.T.] How dare you\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Quiet.\n\n[T.S.] But things are different here in the Sol system. Smash and conquer\u2014like so many traditions of old Torobatl\u2014won't get you far. Ghaul found that out the hard way. The remnants of his Red Legion have learned to adapt.\n\n[T.S.] Let me know if you'd like to do the same. I'd even go against my own custom and consider a payment plan.\n\n[E.C.] How generous. But it seems I have no need. As you've revealed, I have untapped resources at my disposal.\n\n[T.S.] Whichever ones have survived your purge, yes. But weapons are not my most valuable wares, not by a long shot. If you're anything like your father, you'll be far more interested in the information I have to offer.\n\n[E.C.] Send your coordinates. We can discuss face-to-face. But tread lightly. I've yet to decide whether you're worth my mercy.\n\n[T.S.] Oh, I'm honored to host Her Imperial Highness on my humble Shore. It's no palatial estate, but we insects are just happy to have a place to call home.\n\n[End transmission.]",

The roaring of Acolytes. The powerful grip on his shoulders, which even now began to crack under the pressure. \n\nAbove him, a trio of Wizards held his Ghost tight, its bleached shell ensnared by ebony tendrils of controlling spellcraft. It pulled against the bonds but could do nothing but look down at him helplessly.\n\nSING OF HER LIES. SPEAK OF HER TRUTHS.\n\nThe voice was everywhere. As Sok'tol strained to sit up, something slammed him down, pounding his chitinous skull into the stone again and again. He screeched as the bony frill surrounding his face splintered and snapped loose. He felt his jaw dislodge, felt his own teeth crush against his face, felt himself crack and shatter.\n\nBlackness. And then\u2014\n\nAGAIN.\n\nAs his shell knit and restored soulfire flowed anew, Sok'tol, Fifth of the Light, shuddered awake. \n\nThe Acolytes roared again. They crowded the altar, surrounded by a haze of green. Sok'tol peered upward at the Ogre pinning him against the altar. \n\nIt tightened its grip on his shoulders, claws crackling with wrathful energy. It shook its massive head, crowned in an emerald corona, and bellowed in a voice that was not its own:\n\nYOUR STRENGTH BECOMES MINE. AS WILL HERS. SPEAK.\n\nSok'tol concentrated the Light in his armored hand and began to form a grenade, but the shrieking Acolytes reached forward and tore his fingers apart in their claws. \n\nSok'tol bared his teeth and hissed up at the Ogre, whose eyes rolled with fury as a blast of soulfire erupted from its mouth. Sok'tol opened his jaws to howl as he was obliterated.\n\nBlackness. And then\u2014\n\nAGAIN.",

Crow pretended not to notice and kept walking through the woods. He's been in a mood all day, Glint thought with a static sigh. He could use some time alone.\n\nWhen he reached the Hive, Glint resisted the absurd reflex to scan it for compatibility. Instead, he simply assessed, noting the strong arms that could handle the recoil from heavy weapons; the thick shell, built to absorb all manner of firepower; the remains of a bony shield that sizzled nearby, powerful enough to protect\u2014\n\nThe space next to Glint fluctuated as a bone-white Hive Ghost appeared. \n\nThe two froze warily in midair.\n\n\"Hey,\" the Hive Ghost whispered after a moment. \"It's okay.\" Its voice was surprisingly soft. \n\nIts green eye flickered reassuringly and it began to focus Light.\n\nGlint bobbed unsteadily. Crow was fifty yards off, moving carefully through the trees. \"You shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\"It'll be all right,\" it said and hovered lower to the ground, pouring Light into the fallen Hive. The surrounding ferns trembled with the sudden flow of energy.\n\n\"Wait,\" Glint pressed. But the Ghost ignored him as the thick armor of the Hive began to reform. \n\n\"Crow!\" Glint screamed, \"Crow, here!\" And he flew to him without turning back.",

An enormous feathered mantle was mounted carefully on a wooden stand and crowned with a birdlike cowl.\n\nThe hulking form of Saint-14 sat in a wooden chair facing the bed where, impossibly small beneath the blankets, rested the man known as Osiris.\n\nMithrax rapped politely on the doorframe.\n\n\"My friend,\" Saint-14 said. \"It is good of you to come.\"\n\nMithrax approached Saint and bowed. \"It is an honor to be invited,\" he said. \"These visits are pleasant to me.\" \n\nHe held out the covered dish he was carrying in his lower arms, but Saint's eyes remained fixed on Osiris. \n\nThe Titan took a ragged breath. His voice was a hoarse whisper: \"Could the Psion machine\u2026 connect my mind with his? So that I might share his dreams?\"\n\nMithrax felt useless. He spoke softly: \"The Psion tells me the subject must have residual activity for a reading, and Osiris has been asleep very long. Besides, the connection you seek joins the Light of one being to the Light of another, and Osiris is\u2014\"\n\n\"Lightless, yes,\" Saint finished flatly. He leaned forward in his chair, his elbows on his knees, hands clasped before him. He was silent for some time.\n\n\"I will let him sleep alone,\" Saint finally said, and caressed Osiris's hand with impossible tenderness. \"When he wakes, we will dream together once more.\"\n\nHe adjusted the blankets, stood, and nodded toward the covered dish Mithrax still clutched awkwardly.\n\n\"I am hoping that is not more eggplant,\" he said.\n\nMithrax coughed on his Ether. \"The eggplant is most nourishing,\" he protested weakly, and Saint groaned.",

The Ghost began to focus his Light when incoming fire sent him spinning to the ground.\n\n\"What did I tell you about dying in the open?\" the little Ghost cried in frustration. Determined, he rose into the air, but the Hive Knight was already charging across the Trostland cobblestones.\n\nA sudden explosion of Void energy took the Knight by surprise, but it dodged the pulsing shockwaves of a Vortex Grenade. A tall Warlock in a worn green robe loped from the treeline and slid to a stop before Bask. She hastily formed a ball of Light in her palm and slammed it into the ground. Delicate wisps of energy began to rise from the soil.\n\n\"That's not gonna help!\" Bask whirred angrily.\n\nThe Warlock stood, sheltering Bask with her body as he resumed his focus on Jolur. The Knight screeched and resumed fire. A volley of Shredder bolts doubled the Warlock over, but the energy seeping from the rift gave her the strength to keep standing. \n\n\"Thanks,\" said Bask sheepishly.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" she said, gritting her teeth through the gunfire. \n\nA blinding burst of energy surged as Jolur rose to his feet, body shimmering with Light. He braced himself and lobbed an orb of unstable energy that reduced the Knight to howling ash on impact. \n\n\"Appreciate the assist,\" Jolur said to Bask and the Warlock as he brushed dirt from his decrepit boots. \"These guys are stronger than I thought, but it's nothing a Nova Bomb can't handle.\"\n\nThe Warlock inspected the damage to her robe. \"What's going on with these Hive?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Jolur said. \"Lord Saladin sent a group of us down to figure out\u2014\"\n\nAnother blinding burst of energy surged nearby. The Knight rose to its feet, body shimmering with Light. \n\nThe Guardians stood frozen in horror. \n\n\"Since when can they do that?\" Bask squeaked, and the fight began in earnest.",
