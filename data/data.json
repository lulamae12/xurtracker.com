Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it.

The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here.

Awoken and Human Guardians remember nothing, so they just pick new names.\n\nSo I asked them why they chose theirs. Therin puffed out his chest\u2014his armor looked like it had once been really fancy, but it was scuffed and dirty from the road\u2014and said, \"Because it sounds awesome! Remember the name Therin Vai\u2014it's the name of the Guardian who will find the lost Warmind Rasputin!\"\n\nWhen he said that, Lee-4 managed to look exhausted, which is impressive for an Exo.\n\nTherin talked about Rasputin and the Baikonur for a while, so to sidetrack him I asked Nadiya where her name came from. But she just rolled her eyes. \"I don't think Micah's paying me to chitchat.\"\n\n\"You're getting paid?\" Therin said.\n\nLee-4 elbowed him hard.\n\n\"Ow! What was that for?\"\n\n\"To remind you why we're here,\" said Lee-4. It was practically the first thing I'd heard her say.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" I asked.\n\nShe fixed her electric eyes on me. \"Old debts.\"\n\n\"To Micah?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nNadiya slouched against the tallwalk parapet, her head flung back to hang over the side. I thought about pushing her over. \"Good luck with that, whatever that means,\" said Nadiya. \"I'm all about new debts. Preferably other people's debts to me.\"\n\nJust then Lee-4 swung the sniper rifle off her shoulder so fast it almost cracked Nadiya in the head. Lee-4 fitted the scope to her eye and held the weapon perfectly still, without even leaning the barrel against the wall. A pause filled only by Nadiya's complaints\u2014and then Lee fired off a shot.\n\nOn the horizon I saw a shadow fall.\n\n\"Fallen?\" said Therin.\n\n\"Kings,\" Lee confirmed.",

                "ExtLore": "Siegfried's feet touch down on a metal grate ten fathoms deep into the Leviathan, where snaking tunnels split into many different directions. The room is large, empty, and dark. He cycles through the night vision and thermal imaging on his helm, then looks up to his fireteam.\n\nHe can see the shimmering Eliksni camouflage distort the shapes of his seven teammates as they descend the shaft above him on a carbon-weave line. He disables his own. In front of him sits the base of a robotic construct in the likeness of Calus. It is twice his height, and the bare mechanisms of its internal workings creak with age.\n\nFour Cabal Legionaries, two Eliksni Splicers, and a Praxic Sunsinger drop in behind Siegfried and deactivate their cloaks. The Splicers get to work establishing a connection with the automaton while the Legionaries make a perimeter at their back. Siegfried stands with them.\n\nThe Warlock does not take their eyes from the automaton.\n\n\"Splice\u2026 formed.\" One of the Eliksni turns to the Warlock and nods. The Warlock steps forward\u2014\n\n\"Thieves skulking through my Leviathan!\" The automaton bellows with Calus's voice and forcibly bats away a Splicer with a metallic hand. They crash into the adjacent wall and crumple into unconsciousness. The second Splicer leaps back and takes cover behind a Legionary as the Praxic Warlock unleashes a volley of celestial fire into the construct's face. In response, a steely fist bursts through the fire-smoke and crushes the Warlock into the floor.\n\nSiegfried turns toward the Legionaries and shouts, \"Contact!\"\n\nThe Cabal open up with slug rifles; munitions clang against the thick metal. The remaining Splicer aims for the construct's exposed machinery with their Arc pistol.\n\nSiegfried rushes forward, sliding to meet the automaton head on. He ignites in Solar flame and shoulder charges the construct into the chamber wall. He rolls under a retaliating fist and grabs the automaton's chassis, wrestling to spin its back to his fireteam.\n\nThe Sunsinger gasps, alive again. They grab the unconscious Eliksni and take a position amid the Legionaries, shouting, \"CONCENTRATE FIRE!\"\n\nWith one swift motion, the Praxic Warlock combusts brilliantly with Solar Radiance that emboldens the firing line of Cabal shooters and fills the Splicer's heart with courage. Heated slugs puncture and the Arc pistol finds its mark, shorting out one of the automaton's exposed knees.\n\nSlug rifles shred the construct's face as it crashes to the ground and frenetically crawls toward them, tearing metal from the floor with each scraping motion.\n\nThe Titan raises a hand, and in a burst of fiery might, summons a Devastator's maul. He brings the maul down into the automaton's back, demolishing it and sending molten shrapnel skidding across the floor.\n\nSiegfried looks to the Sunsinger, then the rest of the fireteam. \"Contact down\u2026 let's keep going.\"",

A deluge of water spewed from deep within the stone below; gentle tremors rippled through their bodies without notice. The pure sky above them tore like well-worn fabric as fronds of malignant Taken growth crept into the Dreaming City.\n\n\"They will be upon us soon. It was not enough to simply halt Oryx's advance,\" Petra said.\n\nShe had spent months of conversation building the kindling to an idea in Illyn's thoughts prior to the Battle of Saturn: a new Coven, a new class of sister recruits. Now, with the queen's flagship in ruins and the Coven missing several of its most skilled Techeuns, there was no longer the luxury of refusal.\n\n\"I can't hold the Reef with Corsairs alone. I can't search for the queen with looking glasses and a depleted armada. We need more Techeuns, Illyn. You know I'm right.\"\n\nIllyn shook her head. \"We are not weapons for the Queen's Wrath to command\u2026\"\n\nThe Coven's reluctance to forge the next link in the chain of their lineage was a strong one. Since the formation of Eleusinia and the exploitation of Riven, the Elder Techeuns had grown protective of their arts. Techniques and texts were kept close. Despite all that, Petra knew Illyn had always been listening to her words. She too had dreamt of the Harbinger's failure. Of Oryx Taking her sisters.\n\n\"\u2026We will snap shut the Ley Lines and seal the city,\" Illyn concluded.\n\n\"No!\" Petra retorted. \"The queen is lost and might still return.\" She turned to the Coven Mother. \"Of your seven, how many are still alive?\"\n\nPetra felt a mournful flame stoking beneath Illyn's visor. \"Precisely,\" Illyn said. \"We haven't the strength.\"\n\n\"Then heed my requests.\" Petra waved away the mist between them. \"Train more sisters.\"\n\nIllyn finally broke her gaze with the sky and scowled at Petra. \"We haven't the time. Training spans decades.\"\n\n\"Make. It. Work,\" Petra demanded before taking a breath and continuing. \"Illyn, I will do whatever you need. Please, can we work through this together?\"\n\nIllyn's head sunk. She leaned over the cliffside\u2014over the stream of plummeting mist\u2014and watched the flow of water drop into endlessness. \"Send me your candidates. I hope they are stronger than you were.\"",

Her view every day was instead of the same stone chamber she shared with twelve others; it doubled as both training ground and lodging for a new crop of Techeuns. The mustiness made Ylaia crave the open air of the Dreaming City's skyward turrets.\n\nShe imagined them piercing the sky like masts and drawing the clouds into sails. In her mind, the whole city sailed through the Ascendant Ocean, navigating the Ley Lines like currents. Ylaia placed herself there: a voyage, a turret crow's nest in search of distant land, ascendant anchors restraining cloud-sail billows against the wind of her will.\n\nShe tried to introduce that place to this one, to let them meet and exchange atmosphere.\n\n\"Make this real,\" she thought\u2026 but it was nothing more than thought. The concepts were familiar, but the execution was still foreign. Ylaia adjusted the crystal in her hands, as if the orientation mattered. Of all her sisters, only she still couldn't shape the Ley Lines.\n\n\"They're going to shift soon, you know,\" Austyn chided.\n\n\"I know,\" Ylaia spat back without looking. An explosion shook the room, raining plumes of dust over them and breaking her concentration.\n\n\"Damn it!\" Ylaia slammed a fist into the smooth stone and cast the crystal orb across the floor. \"Why are we training in a war zone?\"\n\nAustyn watched the crystal skip to the edge of the chamber. \"This place is built upon a crossroads of Ley Lines. If you can't align with them here\u2026\"\n\n\"Don't say it,\" Ylaia hissed as she stood to retrieve the crystal. \"I need to try again.\"\n\nAs she walked, the wall before her illuminated and split into a doorway. Petra Venj entered the chamber, haggard, soot dulling the sheen of her armor. Ylaia stopped in her tracks. She hid away her embarrassment despite knowing that Petra hadn't seen her cast away the focusing crystal.\n\nPetra's foot tapped the crystal. She bent and scooped it from the ground and looked to Ylaia's empty hands. \"Do not lose this. There aren't many left.\"\n\n\"My apologies.

Give me a moment to focus, please,\" she pleaded, hastily gulping down the tea.\n\n\"You think my voice is sharper than this knife?\" Kalli asked, lifting the scalpel from her back table. \"Duress. You must push through it if you are to survive. Be strong, or you will die. This is your final test.\"\n\nSjari drank quickly and pressed herself to the table once more. She focused on her fingertips and the feel of the hand-worked wood. The grain formed diminutive pathways for her nails to trace; tiny patterns hidden away within the enormity that surrounded them, only revealed by shrinking one's perspective. She let herself drift.\n\nKalli threaded the thin metal edge directly through to the bone of Sjari's skull. A line of incision opened a wave of red. Searing penetration through the layers. Overwhelming electrified senses. They gave way to a calming sting in the discordant firing of nerves. A pattern. The texture. The split between what was and what could be.\n\nIn her mind's eye, Sjari saw the Ley Lines unfurl like budding petals of a living blossom. Nebula-like plumes of pollen.

It was not the first time she had pressed herself into symbiosis with the Ascendant Plane. She'd been through the thoughts of all the sisters in her Coven. She had dreamt with Petra and harvested secrets from her, with the Queen's Wrath being none the wiser. Austyn knew they were meant to save Queen Mara Sov. They were meant to find her and restore the throne. She had been searching the Ley Lines for a path to the queen each night after her training.\n\nHer Coven sisters lay sleeping all around her body, but her mind flew through countless panes of prismatic glass. As they shattered, she flittered from one plane to the next, catching momentary glimpses of incommunicable wonder.\n\nIn the distant cosmos far ahead, Austyn saw a darkened haze of indecipherable noise. Somewhere nestled in the Ley Lines, this shadowed spot was growing. Austyn knew Mara Sov was distant. She knew the queen had obscured herself from her enemies. Austyn had felt a presence reach from the noise toward the Dreaming City more than once. Tonight, she would reach back.\n\nAustyn focused her will on a path to the distant noise and, as she did so, it was. The way was open, but still so far. She reached out with her physical body, placing a hand in the air before her and splitting the oxygen with her touch. She carved a slit in reality, through the molecules of the air, and the path anchored to it at her command.\n\nThe noise descended upon her, and instantly, she was at the precipice.\n\nHand pressed, frozen, paralyzed, and awash in insidious whispers that shredded the doorway into open nothing.\n\nIt tore her consciousness across the cosmos to a grand terrace of onyx swords and emerald flame reigning over a red harbor. Fingers reached like blades from distant hollows. Screaming noise upon noise. A lone figure stood on the terrace aside two empty thrones. Testing. Prodding. Tasting. Breeding war.\n\n\"Austyn!\" A familiar voice pried her back into the waking world. \"Austyn, are you all right?\"\n\nShe woke, soaked in sweat and heat. Petra Venj stood over her, gripping her shoulders.\n\nAustyn struggled to breathe. Her eyes met Petra's.\n\n\"Austyn?\"\n\nThey'd leave you behind if they knew what you just saw, she thought.\n\n\"Just a nightmare,\" Austyn reassured the Queen's Wrath. \"Thank you for waking me.\"",

A mixture of pride and fearful anxiety knotted her stomach, as if the interior of her skin was being tugged into her gut by warm sinew strings. She held the shape of her smile until they had taken their positions within the Blind Well. Austyn, Ylaia, and Sjari formed the core of the party, with the others interlinking in an exterior circle. They situated themselves at key points around a thrumming Wayfinder's Compass that bent the air into wild chromatic slurries. The Well awakened.\n\nThey prepared their minds. Slipped into meditation. Communion in searching. Thirteen voices spoke as one, and then silence as the Well dropped into prisms of glass beneath the novice Coven's feet. Not but a moment ago, they thirteen stood within the Blind Well, hands and minds interlocked. Now they cascaded through a river of possibility, will, and intention.\n\nIt was not long before the connection was made. Queen Mara Sov's voice filled their thoughts, and they drew to it like gravity. The Coven sisters skipped between Ley Lines, ricocheting from time to place until they found themselves swirling in the whirlpool accretion of a brilliant celestine goddess. Their queen.\n\nNot far beyond it, Austyn again saw the noise.\n\nShe kept her eye upon it while each of her sisters reached out, until the image of Mara Sov manifested and her words found footing in understanding. They focused their will upon her words, and before them, a pale screen of fog and glass gave way into a distant Ley Line beyond Sol.\n\n\"You have done well, my Techeuns,\" said Mara, stepping from the nothing and into their presence. She placed her hand on the Wayfinder's Compass. \"Take me home.\"\n\nThe Coven turned their minds back to the Dreaming City, to safety, to Petra. But as they began their return journey through the Ascendant Plane and across the Ley Lines, they felt the presence of another watching. At the edges of the accretion, a din of distorted noise pursued them.\n\nMara glowered at Austyn before turning and raising her palms. With a single word, the Ley Line shattered behind them, sending a lance of energy through the heart of the noise as they sped away toward the Dreaming City. \"I will not suffer a bloodied mongrel at my heels,\" whispered Mara. \"Keep your focus. She will be back.\"\n\nAustyn could feel the noise encircling them again, as it had done to her that night in her bed. It would suffocate them in this dream.\n\nEach time the Coven shifted Ley Lines, so too did the noise. She knew they could not escape it, and through her, so did her sisters. It descended upon them, and as it grew closer, the noise manifested into whispers. Austyn's mind could think of nothing but one name: Xivu Arath.\n\nShe could see the Dreaming City, but the image wasn't clear. The sharpness of the connection was darkening. Her sisters felt her worry. They did not have the strength to escape. Their minds aligned on an action. Austyn grabbed the compass and placed it in Mara Sov's hands. \"We will ensure your arrival.\"\n\nEach sister shifted her thoughts from the Dreaming City to her own corner of the Ascendant Plane, and with a burst of will, they scattered themselves across the Ley Lines. The noise halted momentarily and split in every direction to follow them.\n\nQueen Mara Sov crashed to her feet as she connected with the floor of the Blind Well.\n\n\"My queen!\" Petra looked to the quickly sealing rift from which she fell. \"Where are the others?\"",

The pure sky above them tore like well-worn fabric as fronds of malignant Taken growth crept into the Dreaming City.\n\n\"They will be upon us soon. It was not enough to simply halt Oryx's  advance,\" Petra said.\n\nShe had spent months of conversation building the kindling to an idea in Illyn's thoughts prior to the Battle of Saturn: a new Coven, a new class of sister recruits. Now, with the queen's flagship in ruins and the Coven missing several of its most skilled Techeuns, there was no longer the luxury of refusal.\n\n\"I can't hold the Reef with Corsairs alone. I can't search for the queen with looking glasses and a depleted armada. We need more Techeuns, Illyn. You know I'm right.\"\n\nIllyn shook her head. \"We are not weapons for the Queen's Wrath to command\u2026\"\n\nThe Coven's reluctance to forge the next link in the chain of their lineage was a strong one. Since the formation of Eleusinia and the exploitation of Riven, the Elder Techeuns had grown protective of their arts. Techniques and texts were kept close. Despite all that, Petra knew Illyn had always been listening to her words. She too had dreamt of the Harbinger's failure. Of Oryx Taking her sisters.\n\n\"\u2026We will snap shut the Ley Lines and seal the city,\" Illyn concluded.\n\n\"No!\" Petra  retorted. \"The queen is lost and might still return.\" She turned to the Coven Mother. \"Of your seven, how many are still alive?\"\n\nPetra felt a mournful flame stoking beneath Illyn's visor. \"Precisely,\" Illyn said. \"We haven't the strength.\"\n\n\"Then heed my requests.\" Petra waved away the mist between them. \"Train more sisters.\"\n\nIllyn finally broke her gaze with the sky and scowled at Petra. \"We haven't the time. Training spans decades.\"\n\n\"Make. It. Work,\" Petra demanded before taking a breath and continuing. \"Illyn, I will do whatever you need. Please, can we work through this together?\"\n\nIllyn's head sunk. She leaned over the cliffside\u2014over the stream of plummeting mist\u2014and watched the flow of water drop into endlessness. \"Send me your candidates. I hope they are stronger than you were.\"",

Her view every day was instead of the same stone chamber she shared with twelve others; it doubled as both training ground and lodging for a new crop of Techeuns. The mustiness made Ylaia crave the open air of the Dreaming City's skyward turrets.\n\nShe imagined them piercing the sky like masts and drawing the clouds into sails. In her mind, the whole city sailed through the Ascendant Ocean, navigating the Ley Lines like currents. Ylaia placed herself there: a voyage, a turret crow's nest in search of distant land, ascendant anchors restraining cloud-sail billows against the wind of her will.\n\nShe tried to introduce that place to this one, to let them meet and exchange atmosphere.\n\n\"Make this real,\" she thought\u2026 but it was nothing more than thought. The concepts were familiar, but the execution was still foreign. Ylaia adjusted the crystal in her hands, as if the orientation mattered. Of all her sisters, only she still couldn't shape the Ley Lines.\n\n\"They're going to shift soon, you know,\" Austyn chided.\n\n\"I know,\" Ylaia spat back without looking. An explosion shook the room, raining plumes of dust over them and breaking her concentration.\n\n\"Damn it!\" Ylaia slammed a fist into the smooth stone and cast the crystal orb across the floor. \"Why are we training in a war zone?\"\n\nAustyn watched the crystal skip to the edge of the chamber. \"This place is built upon a crossroads of Ley Lines. If you can't align with them here\u2026\"\n\n\"Don't say it,\" Ylaia hissed as she stood to retrieve the crystal. \"I need to try again.\"\n\nAs she walked, the wall before her illuminated and split into a doorway. Petra Venj entered the chamber, haggard, soot dulling the sheen of her armor. Ylaia stopped in her tracks. She hid away her embarrassment despite knowing that Petra hadn't seen her cast away the focusing crystal.\n\nPetra's foot tapped the crystal. She bent and scooped it from the ground and looked to Ylaia's empty hands. \"Do not lose this. There aren't many left.\"\n\n\"My apologies.

There is no pain, no flesh, no nerves.\"\n\nSjari gripped the sides of the operating table and pressed her back flat, until no air existed between her and the surface beneath\u2014until she felt herself a part of it. She told herself to ignore the grinding of the pestle and thought about how Petra had taught her to use the physical as a transitionary conduit to the Ascendant.\n\n\"Drink this,\" Kalli ordered, handing Sjari a small cup of queensfoil tea.\n\nSjari opened her eyes and released her grip as her meditation broke. \"Yes, Elder sister. Give me a moment to focus, please,\" she pleaded, hastily gulping down the tea.\n\n\"You think my voice is sharper than this knife?\" Kalli asked, lifting the scalpel from her back table. \"Duress. You must push through it if you are to survive. Be strong, or you will die. This is your final test.\"\n\nSjari drank quickly and pressed herself to the table once more. She focused on her fingertips and the feel of the hand-worked wood. The grain formed diminutive pathways for her nails to trace; tiny patterns hidden away within the enormity that surrounded them, only revealed by shrinking one's perspective. She let herself drift.\n\nKalli threaded the thin metal edge directly through to the bone of Sjari's skull. A line of incision opened a wave of red. Searing penetration through the layers. Overwhelming electrified senses. They gave way to a calming sting in the discordant firing of nerves. A pattern. The texture. The split between what was and what could be.\n\nIn her mind's eye, Sjari saw the Ley Lines unfurl like budding petals of a living blossom. Nebula-like plumes of pollen. She let herself slip away until the pain of her flesh was only one of many choices before her.",

It was not the first time she had pressed herself into symbiosis with the Ascendant Plane. She'd been through the thoughts of all the sisters in her Coven. She had dreamt with Petra and harvested secrets from her, with the Queen's Wrath being none the wiser. Austyn knew they were meant to save Queen Mara Sov. They were meant to find her and restore the throne. She had been searching the Ley Lines for a path to the queen each night after her training.\n\nHer Coven sisters lay sleeping all around her body, but her mind flew through countless panes of prismatic glass. As they shattered, she flittered from one plane to the next, catching momentary glimpses of incommunicable wonder.\n\nIn the distant cosmos far ahead, Austyn saw a darkened haze of indecipherable noise. Somewhere nestled in the Ley Lines, this shadowed spot was growing. Austyn knew Mara Sov was distant. She knew the queen had obscured herself from her enemies. Austyn had felt a presence reach from the noise toward the Dreaming City more than once. Tonight, she would reach back.\n\nAustyn focused her will on a path to the distant noise and, as she did so, it was. The way was open, but still so far. She reached out with her physical body, placing a hand in the air before her and splitting the oxygen with her touch. She carved a slit in reality, through the molecules of the air, and the path anchored to it at her command.\n\nThe noise descended upon her, and instantly, she was at the precipice.\n\nHand pressed, frozen, paralyzed, and awash in insidious whispers that shredded the doorway into open nothing.\n\nIt tore her consciousness across the cosmos to a grand terrace of onyx swords and emerald flame reigning over a red harbor. Fingers reached like blades from distant hollows. Screaming noise upon noise. A lone figure stood on the terrace aside two empty thrones. Testing. Prodding. Tasting. Breeding war.\n\n\"Austyn!\" A familiar voice pried her back into the waking world. \"Austyn, are you all right?\"\n\nShe woke, soaked in sweat and heat. Petra Venj stood over her, gripping her shoulders.\n\nAustyn struggled to breathe. Her eyes met Petra's.\n\n\"Austyn?\"\n\nThey'd leave you behind if they knew what you just saw, she thought.\n\n\"Just a nightmare,\" Austyn reassured the Queen's Wrath. \"Thank you for waking me.\"",

A mixture of pride and fearful anxiety knotted her stomach, as if the interior of her skin was being tugged into her gut by warm sinew strings. She held the shape of her smile until they had taken their positions within the Blind Well. Austyn, Ylaia, and Sjari formed the core of the party, with the others interlinking in an exterior circle. They situated themselves at key points around a thrumming Wayfinder's Compass that bent the air into wild chromatic slurries. The Well awakened.\n\nThey prepared their minds. Slipped into meditation. Communion in searching. Thirteen voices spoke as one, and then silence as the Well dropped into prisms of glass beneath the novice Coven's feet. Not but a moment ago, they thirteen stood within the Blind Well, hands and minds interlocked. Now they cascaded through a river of possibility, will, and intention.\n\nIt was not long before the connection was made. Queen Mara Sov's voice filled their thoughts, and they drew to it like gravity. The Coven sisters skipped between Ley Lines, ricocheting from time to place until they found themselves swirling in the whirlpool accretion of a brilliant celestine goddess. Their queen.\n\nNot far beyond it, Austyn again saw the noise.\n\nShe kept her eye upon it while each of her sisters reached out, until the image of Mara Sov manifested and her words found footing in understanding. They focused their will upon her words, and before them, a pale screen of fog and glass gave way into a distant Ley Line beyond Sol.\n\n\"You have done well, my Techeuns,\" said Mara, stepping from the nothing and into their presence. She placed her hand on the Wayfinder's Compass. \"Take me home.\"\n\nThe Coven turned their minds back to the Dreaming City, to safety, to Petra. But as they began their return journey through the Ascendant Plane and across the Ley Lines, they felt the presence of another watching. At the edges of the accretion, a din of distorted noise pursued them.\n\nMara glowered at Austyn before turning and raising her palms. With a single word, the Ley Line shattered behind them, sending a lance of energy through the heart of the noise as they sped away toward the Dreaming City. \"I will not suffer a bloodied mongrel at my heels,\" whispered Mara. \"Keep your focus. She will be back.\"\n\nAustyn could feel the noise encircling them again, as it had done to her that night in her bed. It would suffocate them in this dream.\n\nEach time the Coven shifted Ley Lines, so too did the noise. She knew they could not escape it, and through her, so did her sisters. It descended upon them, and as it grew closer, the noise manifested into whispers. Austyn's mind could think of nothing but one name: Xivu Arath.\n\nShe could see the Dreaming City, but the image wasn't clear. The sharpness of the connection was darkening. Her sisters felt her worry. They did not have the strength to escape. Their minds aligned on an action. Austyn grabbed the compass and placed it in Mara Sov's hands. \"We will ensure your arrival.\"\n\nEach sister shifted her thoughts from the Dreaming City to her own corner of the Ascendant Plane, and with a burst of will, they scattered themselves across the Ley Lines. The noise halted momentarily and split in every direction to follow them.\n\nQueen Mara Sov crashed to her feet as she connected with the floor of the Blind Well.\n\n\"My queen!\" Petra looked to the quickly sealing rift from which she fell. \"Where are the others?\"",

A deluge of water spewed from deep within the stone below; gentle tremors rippled through their bodies without notice. The pure sky above them tore like well-worn fabric as fronds of malignant Taken growth crept into the Dreaming City.\n\n\"They will be upon us soon. It was not enough to simply halt Oryx's  advance,\" Petra said.\n\nShe had spent months of conversation building the kindling to an idea in Illyn's thoughts prior to the Battle of Saturn: a new Coven, a new class of sister recruits. Now, with the queen's flagship in ruins and the Coven missing several of its most skilled Techeuns, there was no longer the luxury of refusal.\n\n\"I can't hold the Reef with Corsairs alone. I can't search for the queen with looking glasses and a depleted armada. We need more Techeuns, Illyn. You know I'm right.\"\n\nIllyn shook her head. \"We are not weapons for the Queen's Wrath to command\u2026\"\n\nThe Coven's reluctance to forge the next link in the chain of their lineage was a strong one. Since the formation of Eleusinia and the exploitation of Riven, the Elder Techeuns had grown protective of their arts. Techniques and texts were kept close. Despite all that, Petra knew Illyn had always been listening to her words. She too had dreamt of the Harbinger's failure. Of Oryx Taking her sisters.\n\n\"\u2026We will snap shut the Ley Lines and seal the city,\" Illyn concluded.\n\n\"No!\" Petra retorted. \"The queen is lost and might still return.\" She turned to the Coven Mother. \"Of your seven, how many are still alive?\"\n\nPetra felt a mournful flame stoking beneath Illyn's visor. \"Precisely,\" Illyn said. \"We haven't the strength.\"\n\n\"Then heed my requests.\" Petra waved away the mist between them. \"Train more sisters.\"\n\nIllyn finally broke her gaze with the sky and scowled at Petra. \"We haven't the time. Training spans decades.\"\n\n\"Make. It. Work,\" Petra demanded before taking a breath and continuing. \"Illyn, I will do whatever you need. Please, can we work through this together?\"\n\nIllyn's head sunk. She leaned over the cliffside\u2014over the stream of plummeting mist\u2014and watched the flow of water drop into endlessness. \"Send me your candidates. I hope they are stronger than you were.\"",

Her view every day was instead of the same stone chamber she shared with twelve others; it doubled as both training ground and lodging for a new crop of Techeuns. The mustiness made Ylaia crave the open air of the Dreaming City's skyward turrets.\n\nShe imagined them piercing the sky like masts and drawing the clouds into sails. In her mind, the whole city sailed through the Ascendant Ocean, navigating the Ley Lines like currents. Ylaia placed herself there: a voyage, a turret crow's nest in search of distant land, ascendant anchors restraining cloud-sail billows against the wind of her will.\n\nShe tried to introduce that place to this one, to let them meet and exchange atmosphere.\n\n\"Make this real,\" she thought\u2026 but it was nothing more than thought. The concepts were familiar, but the execution was still foreign. Ylaia adjusted the crystal in her hands, as if the orientation mattered. Of all her sisters, only she still couldn't shape the Ley Lines.\n\n\"They're going to shift soon, you know,\" Austyn chided.\n\n\"I know,\" Ylaia spat back without looking. An explosion shook the room, raining plumes of dust over them and breaking her concentration.\n\n\"Damn it!\" Ylaia slammed a fist into the smooth stone and cast the crystal orb across the floor. \"Why are we training in a war zone?\"\n\nAustyn watched the crystal skip to the edge of the chamber. \"This place is built upon a crossroads of Ley Lines. If you can't align with them here\u2026\"\n\n\"Don't say it,\" Ylaia hissed as she stood to retrieve the crystal. \"I need to try again.\"\n\nAs she walked, the wall before her illuminated and split into a doorway. Petra Venj entered the chamber, haggard, soot dulling the sheen of her armor. Ylaia stopped in her tracks. She hid away her embarrassment despite knowing that Petra hadn't seen her cast away the focusing crystal.\n\nPetra's foot tapped the crystal. She bent and scooped it from the ground and looked to Ylaia's empty hands. \"Do not lose this. There aren't many left.\"\n\n\"My apologies. I\u2026 I need to try again.\"\n\nPetra scanned the faces of each of the thirteen would-be Techeuns before her.

It was not the first time she had pressed herself into symbiosis with the Ascendant Plane. She'd been through the thoughts of all the sisters in her Coven. She had dreamt with Petra and harvested secrets from her, with the Queen's Wrath being none the wiser. Austyn knew they were meant to save Queen Mara Sov. They were meant to find her and restore the throne. She had been searching the Ley Lines for a path to the queen each night after her training.\n\nHer Coven sisters lay sleeping all around her body, but her mind flew through countless panes of prismatic glass. As they shattered, she flittered from one plane to the next, catching momentary glimpses of incommunicable wonder.\n\nIn the distant cosmos far ahead, Austyn saw a darkened haze of indecipherable noise. Somewhere nestled in the Ley Lines, this shadowed spot was growing. Austyn knew Mara Sov was distant. She knew the queen had obscured herself from her enemies. Austyn had felt a presence reach from the noise toward the Dreaming City more than once. Tonight, she would reach back.\n\nAustyn focused her will on a path to the distant noise and, as she did so, it was. The way was open, but still so far. She reached out with her physical body, placing a hand in the air before her and splitting the oxygen with her touch. She carved a slit in reality, through the molecules of the air, and the path anchored to it at her command.\n\nThe noise descended upon her, and instantly, she was at the precipice.\n\nHand pressed, frozen, paralyzed, and awash in insidious whispers that shredded the doorway into open nothing.\n\nIt tore her consciousness across the cosmos to a grand terrace of onyx swords and emerald flame reigning over a red harbor. Fingers reached like blades from distant hollows. Screaming noise upon noise. A lone figure stood on the terrace aside two empty thrones. Testing. Prodding. Tasting. Breeding war.\n\n\"Austyn!\" A familiar voice pried her back into the waking world. \"Austyn, are you all right?\"\n\nShe woke, soaked in sweat and heat. Petra Venj stood over her, gripping her shoulders.\n\nAustyn struggled to breathe. Her eyes met Petra's.\n\n\"Austyn?\"\n\nThey'd leave you behind if they knew what you just saw, she thought.\n\n\"Just a nightmare,\" Austyn reassured the Queen's Wrath. \"Thank you for waking me.\"",

                "ExtLore": "THIRD-STRING WITCHES - V\n\nPetra watched Sedia preside over the thirteen of the new Coven. A mixture of pride and fearful anxiety knotted her stomach, as if the interior of her skin was being tugged into her gut by warm sinew strings. She held the shape of her smile until they had taken their positions within the Blind Well. Austyn, Ylaia, and Sjari formed the core of the party, with the others interlinking in an exterior circle. They situated themselves at key points around a thrumming Wayfinder's Compass that bent the air into wild chromatic slurries. The Well awakened.\n\nThey prepared their minds. Slipped into meditation. Communion in searching. Thirteen voices spoke as one, and then silence as the Well dropped into prisms of glass beneath the novice Coven's feet. Not but a moment ago, they thirteen stood within the Blind Well, hands and minds interlocked. Now they cascaded through a river of possibility, will, and intention.\n\nIt was not long before the connection was made. Queen Mara Sov's voice filled their thoughts, and they drew to it like gravity. The Coven sisters skipped between Ley Lines, ricocheting from time to place until they found themselves swirling in the whirlpool accretion of a brilliant celestine goddess. Their queen.\n\nNot far beyond it, Austyn again saw the noise.\n\nShe kept her eye upon it while each of her sisters reached out, until the image of Mara Sov manifested and her words found footing in understanding. They focused their will upon her words, and before them, a pale screen of fog and glass gave way into a distant Ley Line beyond Sol.\n\n\"You have done well, my Techeuns,\" said Mara, stepping from the nothing and into their presence. She placed her hand on the Wayfinder's Compass. \"Take me home.\"\n\nThe Coven turned their minds back to the Dreaming City, to safety, to Petra. But as they began their return journey through the Ascendant Plane and across the Ley Lines, they felt the presence of another watching. At the edges of the accretion, a din of distorted noise pursued them.\n\nMara glowered at Austyn before turning and raising her palms. With a single word, the Ley Line shattered behind them, sending a lance of energy through the heart of the noise as they sped away toward the Dreaming City. \"I will not suffer a bloodied mongrel at my heels,\" whispered Mara. \"Keep your focus. She will be back.\"\n\nAustyn could feel the noise encircling them again, as it had done to her that night in her bed. It would suffocate them in this dream.\n\nEach time the Coven shifted Ley Lines, so too did the noise. She knew they could not escape it, and through her, so did her sisters. It descended upon them, and as it grew closer, the noise manifested into whispers. Austyn's mind could think of nothing but one name: Xivu Arath.\n\nShe could see the Dreaming City, but the image wasn't clear. The sharpness of the connection was darkening. Her sisters felt her worry. They did not have the strength to escape. Their minds aligned on an action. Austyn grabbed the compass and placed it in Mara Sov's hands. \"We will ensure your arrival.\"\n\nEach sister shifted her thoughts from the Dreaming City to her own corner of the Ascendant Plane, and with a burst of will, they scattered themselves across the Ley Lines. The noise halted momentarily and split in every direction to follow them.\n\nQueen Mara Sov crashed to her feet as she connected with the floor of the Blind Well.\n\n\"My queen!\" Petra looked to the quickly sealing rift from which she fell. \"Where are the others?\"",
