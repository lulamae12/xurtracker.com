Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

It's not because I don't know my answer, but because I want to feel like I still doubt it. I raise my head.

We continue walking.\n\n\"What'd you name the beast?\"\n\n\"Castus.\"\n\n\"You've been reading too many of the Spider's books .\"\n\n\"Some of 'em are good.\"\n\nI laugh. \"Aren't you the man that said anything you got tying you down can be made into a noose?\"\n\n\"Yeah, some time ago.\"\n\n\"You've been taking a lot of jobs with him ?

We are here to devise a plan.\n\nDO-AJ: We had one. It was rejected. The time for that is long past.\n\nIR: Your plan was to leave the Traveler.\n\nNM-EH: We are unprepared because we waste time debating.\n\nFWC-L2: We were prepared by every conflict that befell the City. This war has been written in the stars. Let it come.\n\nDO-AJ: Mobilize the fleet. We have guns enough. Surely, that option would please Lakshmi.\n\nFWC-L2: Yes.\n\nIR: The fire from your guns would have ricocheted off the Almighty's hull. How do you plan to wound the Pyramid?\n\nCZ: This was settled during the Red War. It has not changed. We will need the fleet in reserve should the situation turn dire.\n\nNM-EH: We will not flee the seat of our Golden Age. Enact war-time powers. A Monarch must be chosen.\n\nIR: [inaudible]\n\nNM-EH: How long has that omen been left buried on the Moon?

They are supported by Guardian operatives. They will work to contain the Darkness while we evacuate nearby assets and evaluate engagement strategies.\n\n[silence]\n\nCZ: In our haste to act, we were caught flat-footed. When we choose to strike again, we must be sure of its efficacy. We may only get one chance. You have all brought wisdom to this meeting. I have considered your council. Executor, I request the New Monarchy support us as they did so graciously when the Red Legion struck. Organize the movement of our people and coordinate with Suraya Hawthorne's contacts to secure them within the walls. Cousin Jalaal, I request Dead Orbit ships ferry the wayward home and provide transit security. In return, you will both be granted full access to the Vanguard's Luna site resources.\n\nNM-EH: A late invitation, but acceptable.\n\nDO-AJ: For the time being, we will protect caravans and aid in relocation.\n\nCZ: Good. Lakshmi, Project Stronghold will require additional printings. Ada-1 has agreed to lend her equipment and expertise to assist in this endeavor. Is this satisfactory?\n\nFWC-L2: Our forges are ready and eager. We request to assist the Bray in evaluating damage to the Warmind.\n\nCZ: Offer the help. Ana will accept it, I'm sure, so long as you defer to her oversight.\n\nFWC-L2: Her standing is tenuous. We believe it amicable to offer partnership, not support.\n\nCZ: You may suggest as much.\n\nIR: Do we have a consensus?\n\n[many voices pledge in agreement]\n\nIR: Adjourned.\n\n[nondescript shuffling and chatter]\n\n[door closing]\n\n[silence]\n\nIR: You offer too much.

The vision immediately dissolved from Mithrax's mind. \n\n\"I am Misraaks, Kell of House Light,\" he said, putting a hand to his chest. \n\nThe Psion paused, then gestured to its chest and Mithrax's head. It held its hand open as if waiting for a response.\n\nMithrax nodded his assent, and into his mind was placed a scattering of orange cubes, a spiraling helix of inky fins, and the sensation of biting through an unripe fruit.\n\nThe vision faded. \"That is your true name?\" Mithrax asked. The Psion gave a short bow. \n\nMithrax smiled. \"I understand why Guardians simply call you 'the Psion,'\" he said. \n\nA swarm of smooth yellow planes fluttered through Mithrax's mind: laughter. \n\nMithrax stepped to the side, and the Psion moved past him. As it did so, there was a final vision: a wink of warm, cheerful brightness, fading but promising to return. \n\n\"To you, as well,\" Mithrax called, and the Psion vanished around the corner.",

The Dreg starts to tremble as the Pirate Lord snaps her fingers and her war beasts stir, rising to their feet and stretching lazily before coming to their mistress's side.\n\n\"The cache on Europa was lost because of your incompetence,\" she says to the Dreg. \"Now Misraaks will come for us.\"\n\nThe war beasts' teeth gleam in the low light. Their claws scrape against the grated floors. Their hides bear the brand of her flag. They are loyal. They are hungry.\n\n\"Mercy,\" the Dreg whispers. He is quiet. Quavering.\n\n\"This IS mercy, Prydis,\" Alaaks says, her voice lowering. \"You haven't faced Misraaks. I have. He knows no mercy or forgiveness.\"\n\nAlaaks hisses a command to her pack, then folds her four arms over her chest. Her war beasts' salivating smiles split wide as they advance.",
