The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

His body ached from lack of Ether, but he dared not pull from his rebreather for fear of discovery. \n\nBesides, if he survived, there would be enough to sate his hunger a dozen times over.\n\nHe and Krilix had been calibrating the landing struts on the crew's Ketch when the ambush hit. A long-range scout rifle slug punched through Krilix in the opening salvo, ripping a fist-sized hole in his chest. He fell on top of Vrisk in a heap of gore as a barrage of gunfire rained down on their position. \n\nVrisk could have shrugged off the Wretch's body and seized his Arc Spear to retaliate. Instead, he simply lay beneath his dying crewmate and let the battle play out. \n\nAfter the shooting stopped, Vrisk listened to their assailants ransack the ship. A mix of guttural Cabal barks and familiar Eliksni chatter marked them as a competing crew, eager to claim the bounty set forth by the reawakened Shipstealer.\n\nBut Vrisk knew what their attackers did not: the relic they sought was not on the Ketch, or even on this planet. It was hidden in a safehouse deep within the asteroid belt beyond Mars. Once Vrisk found the courage to emerge from his hiding place, he would take the relic to Eramiskel himself and claim the reward for his own.\n\nBut there was time for that. For now, the Dreg let the weight and warmth of his dead companion press him into a peaceful slumber, where he dreamed of better days to come.",

She tooled the rifling in her barrels with the steady hand of an artisan. Her dyes, cobalt and ichor, shone bright as beetleshell.\n\nThe other, Gharhet, came from the distant plains. He traded for his wares and sold them dear, and thus he amassed great wealth. He embellished his goods with a rich lacquer the color of flame.\n\nWhen the Primus called for the strongest warriors to serve, the district knew the fighter Tlamus\u2014who had broken all challengers with her keen aim and powerful frame\u2014would represent them. Both Dhutus and Gharhet wished to outfit her with their finest pieces, as having a warrior of her status wear their colors would bring them great honor.\n\nSo Dhutus forged Tlamus a mighty war axe with an ice-blue handle and wide golden blade. Tlamus accepted the gift gladly.\n\nGharhet procured for her a Slug Rifle with bright orange plating, and Tlamus wore it proudly across her back.\n\nNext, Dhutus crafted a Shotgun, metal burnished deep as night with bright vents along the sides, and Tlamus brought it into battle.\n\nIn response, Gharhet bought a helm with thick plating and stout antlers the color of a sunset, and they were soon stained with the blood of Tlamus's foes.\n\nAnd Dhutus saw no end to this. Her shoulders ached from working the forge, and her hands were blistered by burns upon burns.\n\nSo Dhutus issued to Gharhet a challenge, and as he knew no one would raise the weapons of a coward, Gharhet accepted.\n\nThe next dawn found Dhutus on the battlefield waiting for her rival. On her shoulder was her finest weapon: a Rocket Launcher, its barrel a twisting column of seashell blue with gold trim, built as a gift for Tlamus but now wielded by its creator.\n\nFrom across the field, a figure strode forward to meet Dhutus\u2014but it was too wide to be Gharhet; too tall, too muscular. He had bought a champion to fight in his stead.\n\nAn orange sash was draped carelessly across her chest and dragged in the dust with each confident step. Studded orange leathers bound her massive arms and thighs. Strands of coral beads hung from her tusks.\n\nShe greeted Dhutus with a fist to her chest. \"I am Tlamus,\" she said, \"chosen of Gharhet.\"\n\nDhutus could not find her voice, and then Tlamus drew one of her beautiful, terrible weapons, and the rite was soon concluded.",

A haphazard collision of heavy canvas and metallic weave draped over its shoulders. A Vanguard lanyard dangled absurdly from its neck. \n\nIt was small for an Eliksni, but its angular head still towered above Maurice as it hunched over the bar. Four blue eyes looked back at him from above a lipless mouth. It opened, revealing rows of thin, sharp teeth. \n\n\"One item ramen soup,\" the Eliksni croaked stiltedly. \"Please.\" \n\nMaurice held his breath, tightened his grip on his pencil, and grinned. He grinned when he was nervous, and this seemed like as good a time as any. \n\nThe Eliksni grinned back, nodded, and then opened its horrible mouth again. \"I smelled it, and the smell was good,\" it said.\n\nMaurice scanned the bar. His other customers sat frozen, their bowls of ramen steaming silently in front of them. He realized his mouth had apparently decided to talk on its own, as if nothing were wrong. He heard himself ask, \"How spicy, zero to five stars?\"\n\nThe Eliksni had anticipated this question. \"Spicy five stars,\" it said, holding up one hand with three claws splayed, and another with two. \"May I receive additional dead flesh, please?\"\n\n\"You got it,\" Maurice said, his even voice betraying none of his tension, and he turned back to the bubbling pot of broth. Muscle memory took over, and he soon found himself placing a steaming bowl of ramen in front of the creature, who clucked cheerfully.\n\nMaurice took a half-step back. A small crowd was forming in the walkway in front of the restaurant. Some of the customers leaned in as their curiosity overcame their terror. Maurice noticed the woman in seat 2 needed more water, but it could wait. \n\nThe Eliksni raised its arms tentatively, then looked to Maurice again. \"What is the protocol?\" \n\nMaurice found himself unsure of which pair of the Eliksni's eyes to look into and focused on the ramen instead. \"Well, you eat the noodles and pork and egg with\u2014\" \n\n\"Egg,\" repeated the Eliksni, enjoying the unfamiliar word.\n\n\"\u2014yeah, egg. You eat all that with the chopsticks, and you get the broth with the spoon.\" Maurice saw how the Eliksni's claws dwarfed the ceramic spoon. \"Or you can just lift the whole bowl and drink it.\"\n\nMaurice mimed lifting a bowl to his lips. The Eliksni nodded. Its claws tapped the metal on its face and the hissing blue mist ceased. \n\nThe Eliksni held the chopsticks, tested their weight, and respectfully placed them back on the bar before bringing the bowl to its mouth with its upper arms. Above the ramen bowl, Maurice saw all four of the Eliksni's eyes close. \n\nA long moment of tension fell over the shop, the silence broken only by a staccato series of hissing slurps.\n\nFinally, the Eliksni lowered the empty bowl. It breathed in as the blue mist resumed its thin spray. It looked toward Maurice. \"I tasted all of it,\" it said with deep satisfaction. \"I am very thankful.\"\n\nMaurice's grin turned into a tentative smile. \"Glad you enjoyed it.\" \n\nThe Eliksni stood and held out what looked like a small model of the Traveler. It glowed as it floated in the Eliksni's palm. \"Compensation,\" it said.\n\nMaurice reached to take the treasure, then drew his hand back. \"For new customers, there is no charge,\" he said. \"No compensation. Thank you for coming in.\" \n\nThe Eliksni cocked its head, then clucked and the model vanished beneath the folds of its cloak. It smiled at Maurice. \n\n\"You,\" it said, then cleared its throat with a rumble, \"you are a\u2014\" and the five spirited words that followed were replete with hard consonants. \n\nIn the confused silence that followed, the Eliksni nodded graciously, then walked through the crowd outside and deeper into the City.",

Darkness is an entity unto itself. Put simply, Darkness is not Nothing.\n\nBut the Vex? The Vex seek neither Light nor Darkness. They seek Convergence, the reduction of all life to its simplest, most meaningless form. An entelechy of zeros and ones.\n\n\"Evil\" is a word for sentimentalists and fools. But, in the ontology of the sentimental, the Vex are more deserving of the term than the Hive.\n\nGiven a choice between Darkness and Convergence, I would choose Darkness. It is a logical choice.\n\nYet for this they banish me.",
