Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

But when they took my Ghost\u2026 Ooh, when they took my Ghost from me\u2014that was the moment their lives ended.\n\nThey just didn't know it yet.\n\nSince my first rez, I kept to myself. Figured I'd always been that way, in my previous life and all. Joining fireteams, raiding, the Commander's Nightfalls\u2014never my bag. Always walked alone. Never needed nobody. Except for Ghost. Ghost was my only friend. Got no shame in admitting that, not anymore.\n\nNot long after the Taken War, we'd made our way to the EDZ, looking for a place to call our own. Looking for some quiet. Maybe something resembling peace. Ghost and me, we'd been fighting since the Faction Wars. Always fighting. Non-stop fighting. And I was done. We were done. We'd been running solo ops so long, I don't think anyone even noticed we were gone. And we were glad for it.\n\nOur sudden disconnect from the Light changed all that. Like it or not, I was Guardian, he was a Ghost. Peace was never in the cards; the Traveler saw to that. Ghost reconnected to the City networks for the first time in I don't know how long only to find that comms were jammed planet-wide. So we moved west\u2014to our original LZ, to head back to the City, to find the next fight. That's when they found us. The Cabal\u2014Red Legion, we would later learn.\n\nThey marched us north of the Winding Cove. Set up camp within sight of the Shard. They ingested their libations. Got rowdy. They knew we were Lightless; they wanted to see what I was really made of, when I was just meat and air. I said, do your worst. And they did. Beat me within an inch of my final life and then guffawed when Ghost couldn't do anything to get me back on my feet. They ingested more of their bevvies, and one of 'em decided I had one eye too many, and he took it and popped it and laughed some more and asked me what I was gonna do about it. I laughed back, louder and crazier than they liked, and told them I had another. Then one of them, the worst one of them, took hold of Ghost, and said, I'm your Ghost now\u2014I'm the one who decides if you live or die. Ghost was just a pebble in its meat hooks. And with no effort at all, Ghost was in pieces. Before the sun rose, they threw me off a cliff. They should have put a bullet in me. They should have fed me to their War Beasts.\n\nFigure Ghost chose me because I was some kind of hero in my before time. Maybe. More likely I was just another killer.\n\nAnd I sure as hell didn't need no Fists of Havoc to get my hands wet proper.",

Dim and exhausted Motes lie scattered throughout the Derelict, slowly evaporating. She retrieves a Mote from the floor and shines her burning light over the cracked surface. The light struggles to leave the cracks. She lets the disintegrating Mote drop and shatter into dust against the floor grates. It chimes like resonate glass.\n\nThe Drifter whirls around to face the noise, almost losing his footing. He lets his hand slide off his holstered Trust as recognition washes over him. \"Ain't anybody ever tell you not to skulk? It's rude.\"\n\n\"Noted. Are you vacating?\"\n\n\"Road trip. How'd you get in here anyway?\"\n\n\"The airlock was open.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"If I said I were here to run in your rat race, would it change your tune?\"\n\n\"Uh huh\u2026\"\n\nEris drops her shoulders and approaches the Drifter. \"I want your help.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\" His brow furrows with suspicion. \"Why? Didn't you save the universe yet?\" Drifter turns back to shoving bags in bags.\n\n\"It seems to be continually in peril. To be honest, I'm not sure I've helped.\"\n\nEris hands him a bag. \"I need your knowledge.\"\n\n\"You? No.\"\n\n\"I have had some troubling experiences as of late.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's called life.\"\n\n\"I need to know,\" she says and hesitates, half-hearted restraint preceding sacrilege. \"Tell me how to interpret the Darkness.\"\n\n\"What am I, some crusty woo-woo sage? Beat it, kid. I'm packing.\"\n\n\"Do not ignore me,\" Eris says. Her voice is calm and piercing. \"We've both seen beneath the surface.\"\n\nDrifter drops the pack in his hand and picks a jade coin off his workbench.\n\n\"Asher is entrenched in his thinking,\" she says and gently places a palm down on the workbench beside them. \"Ikora\u2026 she tries. She hears, but she doesn't understand. No one is listening.\"\n\nDrifter pockets the coin and turns to face her. He stares deep. \"Experience. Hell of a thing.\" He looks down the gangway of the Derelict and through the gate that would take him to his Haul. \"Favors ain't free. I do this, you owe me.\"\n\nEris nods. Drifter swipes the workbench clean and pulls out a retractable seat for himself.\n\n\"How long you got?\"\n\nThe two sit. They speak. They listen. Linkages forged in Light and Dark of traded secrets as the Derelict hangs in orbit around the Earth. Pacts are made. Soon, there is only the silence of knowing left between them.\n\n\"Next time you fly over the Moon, dust your boots. Tracking that crap all over my floors.\"\n\nEris shakes her head and moves toward the airlock.\n\nDrifter yells after her, \"AND CALL NEXT TIME! I could've blown those fancy eyes straight out of your face.\"\n\n\"I'll try to be more mindful of your many eccentricities in the future.\"",
