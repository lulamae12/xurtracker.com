The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

It's not because I don't know my answer, but because I want to feel like I still doubt it. I raise my head. Gaelin meets my eyes and looks up to the canopy.\n\nHe leans his shoulder into me and drops his voice to a whisper. \"My Clip's  a good one, but you need to realize Ghosts don't know anything.

Red streaks burn in the star-sea sky beyond the vast cloud of asteroids and dust, drawing the shape of a new constellation as the Warmind launches fresh guns.\n\n\"An 'almighty' effort. Splendid.\" Spider steps off a transit craft, alone. \"We could have met in\u2026 a more protected place.\"\n\n\"You don't like being seen with me?\"\n\n\"The Spider is a friend to all, but not all my friends are friends,\" Spider says and focuses his gaze on the Drifter. \"You should have come to me.\"\n\n\"You keep too many bodies around. Bodies can stab you in the back.\"\n\n\"Running shows your back,\" the Spider's voice shudders, \"to everyone.\"\n\nDrifter pauses a moment and looks around at the desolate scape. Small boulders hang in space. They slowly drift towards each other, make contact, and bounce away on random trajectories. Some stick; incorporated via destructive consummation. He scowls and turns back to Spider. \"Stretch your legs. No one here for miles.\"\n\nThe Spider unfurls himself, slurping a heavy vacuumous drag from his rebreather. Fully upright, he dwarfs the Drifter in shadow. \"Isolation\u2026 is not the same as protection, friend.\"\n\n\"Friendship gonna save us from what's coming?\" Drifter asks. He places his fingertips together, the space between his hands resembling a triangle.\n\n\"The odds aren't in your favor, but\u2026\" a guttural laugh ripples from Spider's belly and sends vibration through the loose-packed dirt underfoot, \"I'm the wrong one to come to for comfort.\"\n\n\"I get it. You tried running last time. Didn't work. Now you're trying to hide. Let me give you some advice: that don't work either.\"\n\n\"Hiding? the Spider asks and waits. \"The board changes. The board clears. I don't play, I just price the pieces.\"\n\n\"Cold-blooded. World's ending and you want a run at it for all it's got.\"\n\n\"'End' is a matter of perspective. Devastation is oftentimes,\" he says with a breath, \"profitable.\"\n\n\"What if nothing's left? Skin and bones?\"\n\n\"There's always ivory among the bones.\"\n\n\"Bull.\"\n\nSpider slings a single breathy, \"Ha.\"\n\n\"You remind me of my compatriots.\" Spider wraps his fingers around a small clod of earth drifting by. \"They looked at the Whirlwind, just like you. Scared.\" He closes his hand, crushing the clod into a dense mound. It fractures into several pieces that waft away as Spider releases his grip. \"But here we are, living on anyway.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Fallen.\"\n\n\"Fallen. I hold favor among Witches, and Kells, and whispering agents\u2026 of every shade and shape. My web is vast, and I have proven useful. Let the kings bloody each other. I'll direct the runoff.\"\n\n\"You talking about Guardians? Hate to break it to you, but they're a cheap date.\"\n\n\"Cheap is malleable. Cheap becomes\u2026 cheaper in desperation.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" The Drifter pulls a small and ornate box of Awoken design from his rucksack. \"Who you lookin' for with this anyway?\"\n\nThe Spider steps toward Drifter, smothering his personal space. \"Options, my dear rogue; tangled in the web.\" He takes the box with his dominant arms and plops two stuffed sacks of Ghost shells into the Drifter's hands with his others.\n\n\"Went through hell to get that little box. Don't come with no throne,\" Drifter says, holding his voice steady, jaw tense to stay the trembling.\n\nThe Spider chitters as a shiver runs through him. \"No. Just a looking-glass window. Good business, friend.\" The hulking Fallen Don turns to leave. \"Remember\u2026 remain useful.\"\n\n\"When you find 'em, you sure the past won't come knocking?\"\n\n\"No one minds the Spider.\"\n\n\"Lucky.\"",

Dim and exhausted Motes lie scattered throughout the Derelict, slowly evaporating. She retrieves a Mote from the floor and shines her burning light over the cracked surface. The light struggles to leave the cracks. She lets the disintegrating Mote drop and shatter into dust against the floor grates. It chimes like resonate glass.\n\nThe Drifter whirls around to face the noise, almost losing his footing. He lets his hand slide off his holstered Trust as recognition washes over him. \"Ain't anybody ever tell you not to skulk? It's rude.\"\n\n\"Noted. Are you vacating?\"\n\n\"Road trip. How'd you get in here anyway?\"\n\n\"The airlock was open.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"If I said I were here to run in your rat race, would it change your tune?\"\n\n\"Uh huh\u2026\"\n\nEris drops her shoulders and approaches the Drifter. \"I want your help.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\" His brow furrows with suspicion. \"Why? Didn't you save the universe yet?\" Drifter turns back to shoving bags in bags.\n\n\"It seems to be continually in peril. To be honest, I'm not sure I've helped.\"\n\nEris hands him a bag. \"I need your knowledge.\"\n\n\"You? No.\"\n\n\"I have had some troubling experiences as of late.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's called life.\"\n\n\"I need to know,\" she says and hesitates, half-hearted restraint preceding sacrilege. \"Tell me how to interpret the Darkness.\"\n\n\"What am I, some crusty woo-woo sage? Beat it, kid. I'm packing.\"\n\n\"Do not ignore me,\" Eris says. Her voice is calm and piercing. \"We've both seen beneath the surface.\"\n\nDrifter drops the pack in his hand and picks a jade coin off his workbench.\n\n\"Asher is entrenched in his thinking,\" she says and gently places a palm down on the workbench beside them. \"Ikora\u2026 she tries. She hears, but she doesn't understand. No one is listening.\"\n\nDrifter pockets the coin and turns to face her. He stares deep. \"Experience. Hell of a thing.\" He looks down the gangway of the Derelict and through the gate that would take him to his Haul. \"Favors ain't free. I do this, you owe me.\"\n\nEris nods. Drifter swipes the workbench clean and pulls out a retractable seat for himself.\n\n\"How long you got?\"\n\nThe two sit. They speak. They listen. Linkages forged in Light and Dark of traded secrets as the Derelict hangs in orbit around the Earth. Pacts are made. Soon, there is only the silence of knowing left between them.\n\n\"Next time you fly over the Moon, dust your boots. Tracking that crap all over my floors.\"\n\nEris shakes her head and moves toward the airlock.\n\nDrifter yells after her, \"AND CALL NEXT TIME! I could've blown those fancy eyes straight out of your face.\"\n\n\"I'll try to be more mindful of your many eccentricities in the future.\"",

The stench of the Taken permeated her nostrils: ozone, gun lubricant, and the sickly sweet burn of soulfire.\n\nThe fusion rifle sounded again, closer this time. The shot was met with garbled hisses and return gunfire as the Taken rallied.\n\nAfter her abandonment, Sjari had tried to move as little as possible so as not to attract the attention of the Taken patrols that periodically swept the area. But the fighting moved closer, now a dozen meters from her hiding place. She quieted her fear and let her mind go lax, encouraging them to overlook her.\n\nShe had staved off the prying minds of the Taken Psions by lowering her heart rate and entering a deep meditative trance, sometimes for many hours at a time. But each time she re-emerged into her body, its demands became harder to ignore. She was desperate for food, for water, for anything.\n\nDespite all her training, she was nearing the end of her resolve. Until she heard a voice\u2014a soft, clear whisper in her ear: \"Have faith, my Techeuns. You are lost, but not forgotten. Help is on the way.\"\n\nIt seemed that Queen Mara's promise would finally come to pass. There was yet hope.",

                "ExtLore": "To be the first Eliksni to bask in the presence of the Traveler since the Whirlwind was an honor that Mithrax, Kell of House Light, never imagined for himself. As he stood on the Tower walkway below the scar left in the wake of the Almighty, he meditated on the choices in his life that had led to this point. He wondered if there was a unifying thread binding all those events together. But he would have no time to ponder such things.\n\nA shadow crept over Mithrax: broad shoulders, a curling horn. Seeing the stark outline of Lord Shaxx looming on the stairs elicited centuries-old instincts, and it was temperance that kept Mithrax's hands from his weapon. \n\n\"I didn't expect to actually find you here,\" Shaxx said as he continued down the stairs with slow, plodding steps. \"Were you there?\"\n\n\"What?\" \n\nShaxx came to stand beside Mithrax at the railing. \"Were you there?\" he asked again. This time, he pointed, without looking, to a place on the horizon beyond the Traveler.\n\nMithrax followed Shaxx's gesture with his eyes. He did not understand. \n\n\"The Battle of Six Fronts,\" Shaxx insisted, with uncharacteristic softness. \"Do you know how many Fallen I killed there?\" \n\nMithrax bristled at the question, and he felt that instinctual urge to reach for his weapons again. But the presence of the Traveler and the question that nagged at the back of his mind stayed his hands. \"How many?\" he asked, not wanting to know the answer. \n\nShaxx deflated, folded his arms over the railing, and rested his considerable weight against it. \"Hundreds,\" he said quietly. \"All of them died afraid.\"\n\nMithrax felt Ether mixing with bile in the back of his throat. His limbs trembled, rage burned in his gut, demanding manifestation. But he tempered his anger, sighed so deep that the Ether on his breath was briefly visible as an iridescent cloud.\n\n\"How many Humans have you killed?\" Shaxx wondered.\n\n\"Too many,\" Mithrax answered, and even that felt insufficient on his tongue; the thought of it twisted his insides around. He sighed again, deeper this time, and Shaxx watched the sublimated Ether glitter in the dim light. \n\n\"When I heard you were in the Tower,\" Shaxx said, \"I thought I'd just throw you over the edge of the wall. I thought about the people I watched die at the hands of your Houses over the years. The Lightless torn limb from limb during the Dark Age.\" He snorted out a rueful laugh. \"Then I started to think about them.\"\n\nSilence hung in the air for a moment, long enough for Mithrax to ask: \"Who?\"\n\n\"Three scavengers. Huddled together in a collapsed storm drain. They had stolen food during a\u2026 a time of famine. Maybe it was for themselves, maybe another settlement, maybe family\u2026\" Shaxx shrugged. \"I killed them. All three, with my bare hands.\"\n\n\"My victims were Humans too,\" Shaxx clarified, and the Kell felt his anger twist into confusion. \"I was a Warlord in the Dark Ages. Convinced myself of the necessity of my own barbarism by painting it with noble colors. Those loyal to me built a legend that masked the blood and the rot. But it's still there.\" He tapped his fingers against his breastplate. \"Deep down.\"\n\nThe shadows had become long, stars now visible in the sky, and the Traveler was cast in half shadow.\n\n\"There was a ship,\" Mithrax eventually replied. \"It may have been soldiers. Civilians. I do not know.\" He looked away from the Traveler as he spoke. \"I led a boarding party onto it. We slaughtered any who resisted and rounded up those who surrendered.\"\n\nShaxx turned to look at Mithrax, a wordless question in his faceless mask.\n\n\"We argued what to do with the prisoners. Some suggested we keep them as warning-trophies. Others said to barter with them.\" Mithrax looked away, shoulders sagged. \"But I was young. Impatient.\" He closed his eyes. \"I opened the airlock. It seemed the simplest solution.\"\n\nBoth soldiers sank into silence again and remained so as the last glimpse of sunlight descended beyond the horizon. Shaxx sullenly took his leave, and Mithrax was left with the remnants of anger and confusion, and paradoxically\u2014an answer.\n\nHe saw then the thread of choices leading to this moment. The choices that led to the Great Machine and away from a fate like Eramis had suffered. It was something both he and Shaxx learned to accept in spite of a lifetime of experience telling them otherwise.\n\nMercy.",

And you know better than to return to me empty-handed. At least I thought you knew.\" Spider narrowed his eyes at his trembling Associate. \n\n\"I do, the Spider. I\u2026 I have information, but not about Darkness. I saw the Crow. Tailing the Golem and his crew.\" \n\n\"The Vanguard has him sniffing around Basilius, hm? So we do have something to trade with the empress after all. Not that it'll do her any good; my little bird  is devilishly hard to catch.\" Spider leaned forward. \"Now HE would've gotten me something useful from Europa. You might've learned from him.\" \n\n\"Yes, the Spider.\" Arrha nodded vigorously. The faint sounds of revelry drifted in from down the hall, where the other Associates were enjoying their week's earnings. \n\n\"Avrok already told me about Crow's new assignment as Vanguard agent. Apparently, he's placed quite the wager on one of the Cabal's silly Rites ,\" the Spider chuckled. \"Avrok should've dared him to bet his freedom. Could stand to win my whole trove, he's that valuable.\" \n\n\"Yes, the Spider,\" Arrha repeated. Out of corner of his eye, he could see his share of Ether waiting in the corner. \n\n\"Oh, take your wages and go. I ought to dock you for bringing me nothing, but I'm feeling generous this week.\" Spider's voice dropped into a growl. \"Remember that I am good to you, Arrha.\" \n\nArrha nodded as he scrambled to grab his Ether tanks and get out. Finally alone, the Spider sat back in his throne. \n\n\"It's Crow, really, that needs the reminder,\" he mused aloud. \"I wonder how I might give it to him?\"",
