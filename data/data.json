The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

It's not because I don't know my answer, but because I want to feel like I still doubt it. I raise my head. Gaelin meets my eyes and looks up to the canopy.\n\nHe leans his shoulder into me and drops his voice to a whisper. \"My Clip's  a good one, but you need to realize Ghosts don't know anything.

If you think something's coming unwound, you need to sit down and talk it out.\"\n\n\"Wait\u2026 did Clip change yo\u2014\"\n\n\"Please,\" Gaelin scoffs. \"You're paranoid.\" He turns to keep walking and calls back, \"Life changes you.

We continue walking.\n\n\"What'd you name the beast?\"\n\n\"Castus.\"\n\n\"You've been reading too many of the Spider's books .\"\n\n\"Some of 'em are good.\"\n\nI laugh. \"Aren't you the man that said anything you got tying you down can be made into a noose?\"\n\n\"Yeah, some time ago.\"\n\n\"You've been taking a lot of jobs with him ?

But first: ACD stands for Active Contact Defense. It is not an AC-DC Feedback Fence and it is not named for any work of pre-classical music. I am not winking. That is a malfunction. \n\nKessler Syndrome occurs when a planet's orbitals fill up with fast-moving debris, which strikes other debris and shatters it in a chain reaction. Soon you can't put up a satellite without it being shredded by a swarm of junk. To protect against debris, Golden Age warsats are shielded by a kinetic superconductor that transforms a punch into a charge. \n\nThanks to enemy action, we have a lot of downed warsats. With some tweaking, we can peel out the superconductor and produce a personal defense system. Like so.",

After Empress Caiatl's announcement, every Legionnaire in the land tank had come to jealously salute him for his promotion. It was the appointment of a lifetime. \n\nDeep within the Halphas Electus, Ignovun oversaw his arena's preparation. There was the hanging of Caiatl's banners, the anointing of his ammunition, and the intonement of the Litany of the Chosen by an imperial mythkeeper. He was fitted for new armor that gleamed in the light. He was briefed on the protocols of the Rite, and the expectations of his victory. \n\nBut now, alone in the arena, doubt creeps into Ignovun's thoughts. Ghaul believed that the strength of the smallmen was their Light. He reasoned that the power of the Traveler, like any weapon, could be stripped from the enemy and used against them. Clearly, he was wrong. \n\nIgnovun believes differently. Their strength comes not from Light, but from death. The Guardians are already walking corpses, and yet they fight on. They have all died a thousand times, while Ignovun has yet to die even once. How can he defeat an opponent whom death cannot best? \n\nSuddenly, the treacherous ravings of Ixel, the Far-Reaching did not seem so absurd. If the Cabal are to triumph over the smallmen, they will have to succeed where Ghaul failed. They will have to bring mortality to the Vanguard. \n\nIgnovun knows that these musings will not save him. But he does not fear: if the smallmen can face death, then so can he.",

Bioluminescent pollen swirled in her wake, barely visible in the glow of sundown. Cau'tor closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, reveling in the heady scent that marked the beginning of the wet season.\n\n\"Why did you bring me here?\" his daughter asked. Even as she spoke, Cau'tor pictured her from memory: a small child frolicking in brightly colored robes. He opened his eyes and saw a full-grown warrior in a towering battlesuit.\n\nHe gestured towards the plated broadsword stowed on her hip. \"The scribes said you fought ferociously in sparring this morning.\"\n\n\"My blade is insatiable,\" she replied, brandishing the weapon and playfully pointing it at her father. Her smile diminished slightly. \"You could have seen it yourself.\"\n\nCau'tor did his best to hide a wince. \"I will soon enough, Ta'nam.\"\n\nTa'nam sheathed the blade. Dried grass and petals crunched under Cau'tor's sabatons as he met his daughter and placed a hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"So what's this about\u2014a reminder of home on the eve of battle?\" Ta'nam asked.\n\nHer father scoffed. \"Do you really need reminding?\"\n\nTa'nam grimaced. \"I miss it every day.\"\n\n\"We all do,\" her father said with a heavy sigh. \"No, I wanted you to have one last chance to see it with your own eyes.\"\n\nTa'nam turned, her brow furrowed. \"Last chance?\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Cau'tor called out. A low rumble resonated through their bones and the world shifted. Distant mountains undulated and stretched towards the sky; flowers burst into clouds of wriggling bubbles. The world blurred as light and matter drained like viscous fluid towards a growing rift in the sky\u2014a shadow that grew until it consumed them.\n\nThey woke aboard the Barbatos Rex, still streaming through the stars. Their hands were clasped around the handle of a rusted antique blade. A Psion stood nearby as the last spectral tendrils of psionic energy connecting the three of them dissipated.\n\nCau'tor nodded at the Psion. \"Leave us.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Ta'nam said as soon as they were alone.\n\nCau'tor held the blade up. \"Four generations ago, this weapon earned our family's place in the empire. Its history makes it a strong locus for the mind-walk.\" He studied the knife carefully, testing its weight distribution. \"But history is a luxury of the victor.\"\n\nCau'tor took the weapon in both hands and broke it in half, grinding the brittle material in his gauntlets.\n\nTa'nam recoiled slightly. \"Father\u2026\"\n\n\"The world this came from is gone,\" Cau'tor continued. \"Home is no longer behind us. It is ahead in the distance, past a towering mountain, and over a great sea.\"\n\nTa'nam nodded. \"We are Cabal. We eat the mountains, and drink the seas.\"\n\nCau'tor leaned forward. \"But you cannot do this if your hunger is sated by indulgent reverie. So we will never walk these thoughts again.\"\n\nTa'nam stiffened. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"Sol is a graveyard for our people. But those warriors never watched our cities burn in soulfire. The memory of home should not be a comfort, my child, but the wound that drives your blood frenzy.\"\n\nTa'nam nodded, but the knot in her gut forced her to speak. \"Do you fear them, Father? The Sol warriors?\"\n\nCau'tor smiled proudly, and took his daughter's hand. \"I do not, my child. Because I fight with Ta'nam, and her blade is insatiable.\"",

She peeked out of the cavern's makeshift scrap-metal door and saw asteroids drifting over the Shore like sleeping goliaths in a lavender sea.\n\nScreeb chitters echoed through the air, grabbing the Centurion's attention. She snapped the door shut and readied her Slug Rifle, listening as the sound swelled. When silence finally returned, she crumpled against the wall and wearily dropped her weapon. The gun had been issued in her family's name and bathed in her brother's blood. Now it was a fading memento, lying in the dust beside a vigil of empty helmets.\n\nThe message played over again in her mind and she snarled. A crown. A gauntlet. A chalice. Nothing more than metal tortured with heat and molded into something else. Into someone else's vision. What had the empire molded her into? The low moan of some ancient cable resonated through her pressure suit, now comically oversized for her atrophied muscles.\n\nShe swung her gauntlet and crushed the comm device for good measure. Thresher engines roared in the distance, the sound of countless Legionaries answering the call. She hunkered down and fell into a deep slumber.",

Why do you languish?\"\n\nVal'ast looked away. \"I am sorry, Empress.\"\n\n\"Do not be sorry, my brother,\" Caiatl said.\n\nVal'ast sighed. \"For years, every day has been about survival. Just trying to stay in the fight. But now\u2026\" He trailed off and grasped the sheets of his bed, a cheap fabric but still softer than anything he'd felt in years.\n\n\"When you war for so long, peace can become its own struggle,\" Caiatl said.\n\nVal'ast let the fabric fall from his hand. \"I thought I was Acrius reborn, claiming another sun for our kind.\" He gazed out the porthole. \"But I failed.\"\n\nCaiatl smiled. \"I've always loved that tale.\" She pulled a stool over and sat. \"Did you know that there used to be more to it?\"\n\nVal'ast shook his head.\n\n\"It's an older version, not as popular in modern times, but I was lucky enough to learn it as a child,\" the empress continued. \"Before Acrius, three warriors sought to climb a great mountain and grasp the sun, but a terrible beast stood in their way.\n\n\"The first tried to outwit the beast and sneak through the shadows, but the beast smelled him still and ate the warrior in a single bite.\n\n\"The second tried to escape the beast, crafting a device to harness the wind and soar upward. But the fickle wind changed its mind and tossed her into the beast's maw.\n\n\"The third warrior challenged the beast head on, Severus in hand. She also fell to the beast's gnashing teeth, but not before her blade tasted blood.\"\n\nVal'ast frowned. \"They all failed?\"\n\nCaiatl considered the question. \"The first two, certainly. They thought battle could be avoided. But the third warrior died with pride and honor.\"\n\nVal'ast pondered for a moment. \"Even in defeat, she left her mark on her foe.\"\n\nCaiatl nodded. \"And the next time one of her kin faced it, the beast would be one blow closer to death.\"\n\n\"Did more come?\" Val'ast questioned.\n\n\"Of course!\" Caiatl exclaimed. \"They were Cabal, and the sun was theirs to claim. Over and over, their mightiest fell. But each time, another wound was struck, until the day came when a warrior landed the final blow. That warrior was Acrius.\"\n\nVal'ast frowned. \"Ever since I was a child, I saw Acrius as a hero\u2026\"\n\n\"He may have been,\" Caiatl replied as she clasped Val'ast's hand in hers. \"But so was the warrior who struck first.\"\n\nVal'ast's eyed glistened as he held her grip firmly. \"Thank you, Empress.\"\n\nCaiatl shook her head. \"My brother, it is the empire who thanks you.\"",

As he braced behind a Vex tower and clutched his empty rifle, he recalled his legacy of hasty retreats.\n\nHe had run from Wire Rifle enfilades and soulfire barrages on the detritus flotillas of the Reef.\n\nHe had fled the relentless advance of the chronomatons, nearly boiling in his suit amidst mercurial deserts.\n\nMost of all, he had run from the Light-infested husks, the undying Guardians of Sol. Time and again, he saved his own neck, only for the Legion to find a new assignment and cast him back into the fray; they knew he was weak, but with Legionaries falling in droves, there was no other choice.\n\n(A roar sweeps through the canyon as a smoking Thresher tumbles end over end into oblivion.)\n\nVatoc bore no guilt over his survival; to a Psion, survival was all you had. There was no honor to be gained, no advancement within ranks, no wealth to be accumulated. All the Legion left you with was your life, and Vatoc was going to make sure it lasted as long as possible.\n\nBut that was before Ghaul had been melted down to atoms and scattered across the stars. Before the failed gambit with the Warlock's time device. Before the Almighty, gleaming triumph of the Legion, was tossed like a pebble and swatted aside by an indifferent god.\n\nNow came Empress Caiatl, and with her, the promise of something Vatoc never imagined he would have: freedom. The full might of the empire had arrived in a cavalcade of frigates and carriers, filling the space between worlds with destructive power. For the first time in his life, Vatoc's choice was not merely just to survive, but a choice of what to live for.\n\n(A Colossus barks a rallying cry; a cacophony of Slug Rifles echoes in response.)\n\nThe battle swelled around him and his compatriots fell. He could see the route to safety. Dark crevasses tucked between tepui where he could run and hide. Where he knew he could survive.\n\n(Vatoc reloads his rifle and sings an oath to his empress.)\n\nHe had been a coward before, but no longer.",

I believe this recipe is both old and born of the lower class, a case of poor laborers devising ingenious (yet challenging) ways to take unsold goods and turn them into something comforting and delicious. \n\nThat Caiatl chose this as a main dish for an official gathering speaks to the optics she wants to present; she may be trying to differentiate herself from the opulence of the Calus era and the utilitarianism of Ghaul's rule by relating to the common folk of the empire. \n\nNote that decryption was only mostly successful, and some data degradation occurred.

Bioluminescent pollen swirled in her wake, barely visible in the glow of sundown. Cau'tor closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, reveling in the heady scent that marked the beginning of the wet season.\n\n\"Why did you bring me here?\" his daughter asked. Even as she spoke, Cau'tor pictured her from memory: a small child frolicking in brightly colored robes. He opened his eyes and saw a full-grown warrior in a towering battlesuit.\n\nHe gestured towards the plated broadsword stowed on her hip. \"The scribes said you fought ferociously in sparring this morning.\"\n\n\"My blade is insatiable,\" she replied, brandishing the weapon and playfully pointing it at her father. Her smile diminished slightly. \"You could have seen it yourself.\"\n\nCau'tor did his best to hide a wince. \"I will soon enough, Ta'nam.\"\n\nTa'nam sheathed the blade. Dried grass and petals crunched under Cau'tor's sabatons as he met his daughter and placed a hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"So what's this about\u2014a reminder of home on the eve of battle?\" Ta'nam asked.\n\nHer father scoffed. \"Do you really need reminding?\"\n\nTa'nam grimaced. \"I miss it every day.\"\n\n\"We all do,\" her father said with a heavy sigh. \"No, I wanted you to have one last chance to see it with your own eyes.\"\n\nTa'nam turned, her brow furrowed. \"Last chance?\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Cau'tor called out. A low rumble resonated through their bones and the world shifted. Distant mountains undulated and stretched towards the sky; flowers burst into clouds of wriggling bubbles. The world blurred as light and matter drained like viscous fluid towards a growing rift in the sky\u2014a shadow that grew until it consumed them.\n\nThey woke aboard the Barbatos Rex, still streaming through the stars. Their hands were clasped around the handle of a rusted antique blade. A Psion stood nearby as the last spectral tendrils of psionic energy connecting the three of them dissipated.\n\nCau'tor nodded at the Psion. \"Leave us.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Ta'nam said as soon as they were alone.\n\nCau'tor held the blade up. \"Four generations ago, this weapon earned our family's place in the empire. Its history makes it a strong locus for the mind-walk.\" He studied the knife carefully, testing its weight distribution. \"But history is a luxury of the victor.\"\n\nCau'tor took the weapon in both hands and broke it in half, grinding the brittle material in his gauntlets.\n\nTa'nam recoiled slightly. \"Father\u2026\"\n\n\"The world this came from is gone,\" Cau'tor continued. \"Home is no longer behind us. It is ahead in the distance, past a towering mountain, and over a great sea.\"\n\nTa'nam nodded. \"We are Cabal. We eat the mountains, and drink the seas.\"\n\nCau'tor leaned forward. \"But you cannot do this if your hunger is sated by indulgent reverie. So we will never walk these thoughts again.\"\n\nTa'nam stiffened. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"Sol is a graveyard for our people. But those warriors never watched our cities burn in soulfire. The memory of home should not be a comfort, my child, but the wound that drives your blood frenzy.\"\n\nTa'nam nodded, but the knot in her gut forced her to speak. \"Do you fear them, Father? The Sol warriors?\"\n\nCau'tor smiled proudly, and took his daughter's hand. \"I do not, my child. Because I fight with Ta'nam, and her blade is insatiable.\"",

This log focuses on a single file we were able to decrypt; for the full report on the contents of that data breach and further decryption attempts, please see log R11312.\n\nOstensibly, this file is a recipe for a dish to be served at some sort of official gathering in Caiatl's honor. The ingredients mentioned here have been seen in a variety of ancient Cabal texts, and analysis of the empire's economic history implies that they are considered cheap and undesirable. I believe this recipe is both old and born of the lower class, a case of poor laborers devising ingenious (yet challenging) ways to take unsold goods and turn them into something comforting and delicious. \n\nThat Caiatl chose this as a main dish for an official gathering speaks to the optics she wants to present; she may be trying to differentiate herself from the opulence of the Calus era and the utilitarianism of Ghaul's rule by relating to the common folk of the empire. \n\nNote that decryption was only mostly successful, and some data degradation occurred. Cryptarch's comments are in-line for ease of understanding. Some translations remain ambiguous, but I've provided my best hypotheses.\n\n// FILE START //\u2014 [CBX PARSER ERROR]\n\n\u2014 [CBX PARSER ERROR] \n\n\u2014 [CBX PARSER ERROR] until the solvent mixture has blended together.\n\n\u2014 Pulverize atlotl tendons until just pliable and surfaces begin to crack, then dredge in solvent mixture and let soak for [36\u201384 hours; the cycle referenced here is unknown, estimates are conservative guess].\n\n\u2014 To make the [black cube], crush citrus mixture, then drain through a sieve.

Bioluminescent pollen swirled in her wake, barely visible in the glow of sundown. Cau'tor closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, reveling in the heady scent that marked the beginning of the wet season.\n\n\"Why did you bring me here?\" his daughter asked. Even as she spoke, Cau'tor pictured her from memory: a small child frolicking in brightly colored robes. He opened his eyes and saw a full-grown warrior in a towering battlesuit.\n\nHe gestured towards the plated broadsword stowed on her hip. \"The scribes said you fought ferociously in sparring this morning.\"\n\n\"My blade is insatiable,\" she replied, brandishing the weapon and playfully pointing it at her father. Her smile diminished slightly. \"You could have seen it yourself.\"\n\nCau'tor did his best to hide a wince. \"I will soon enough, Ta'nam.\"\n\nTa'nam sheathed the blade. Dried grass and petals crunched under Cau'tor's sabatons as he met his daughter and placed a hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"So what's this about\u2014a reminder of home on the eve of battle?\" Ta'nam asked.\n\nHer father scoffed. \"Do you really need reminding?\"\n\nTa'nam grimaced. \"I miss it every day.\"\n\n\"We all do,\" her father said with a heavy sigh. \"No, I wanted you to have one last chance to see it with your own eyes.\"\n\nTa'nam turned, her brow furrowed. \"Last chance?\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Cau'tor called out. A low rumble resonated through their bones and the world shifted. Distant mountains undulated and stretched towards the sky; flowers burst into clouds of wriggling bubbles. The world blurred as light and matter drained like viscous fluid towards a growing rift in the sky\u2014a shadow that grew until it consumed them.\n\nThey woke aboard the Barbatos Rex, still streaming through the stars. Their hands were clasped around the handle of a rusted antique blade. A Psion stood nearby as the last spectral tendrils of psionic energy connecting the three of them dissipated.\n\nCau'tor nodded at the Psion. \"Leave us.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Ta'nam said as soon as they were alone.\n\nCau'tor held the blade up. \"Four generations ago, this weapon earned our family's place in the empire. Its history makes it a strong locus for the mind-walk.\" He studied the knife carefully, testing its weight distribution. \"But history is a luxury of the victor.\"\n\nCau'tor took the weapon in both hands and broke it in half, grinding the brittle material in his gauntlets.\n\nTa'nam recoiled slightly. \"Father\u2026\"\n\n\"The world this came from is gone,\" Cau'tor continued. \"Home is no longer behind us. It is ahead in the distance, past a towering mountain, and over a great sea.\"\n\nTa'nam nodded. \"We are Cabal. We eat the mountains, and drink the seas.\"\n\nCau'tor leaned forward. \"But you cannot do this if your hunger is sated by indulgent reverie. So we will never walk these thoughts again.\"\n\nTa'nam stiffened. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"Sol is a graveyard for our people. But those warriors never watched our cities burn in soulfire. The memory of home should not be a comfort, my child, but the wound that drives your blood frenzy.\"\n\nTa'nam nodded, but the knot in her gut forced her to speak. \"Do you fear them, Father? The Sol warriors?\"\n\nCau'tor smiled proudly, and took his daughter's hand. \"I do not, my child. Because I fight with Ta'nam, and her blade is insatiable.\"",

The soldier had been gazing solemnly out a porthole when the sound of her voice startled him. He turned suddenly, then winced in pain. Caiatl saw darkened synthetic fabric enveloping his torso and the entirety of his right arm, which itself looked frail and withered. She knew immediately that this Cabal would see no more battles.\n\n\"My empress!\" the warrior responded, clasping a fist to his chest with his unwrapped arm. Caiatl saluted in return.\n\nThe empress glanced at a monitor displaying the patient's data. \"Val'ast, born of Val'tui.\" She looked out the porthole; the brilliance of Sol beamed back at her. \"The empire has returned for you, Red Legionary, yet your heart seems heavy. Why do you languish?\"\n\nVal'ast looked away. \"I am sorry, Empress.\"\n\n\"Do not be sorry, my brother,\" Caiatl said.\n\nVal'ast sighed. \"For years, every day has been about survival. Just trying to stay in the fight. But now\u2026\" He trailed off and grasped the sheets of his bed, a cheap fabric but still softer than anything he'd felt in years.\n\n\"When you war for so long, peace can become its own struggle,\" Caiatl said.\n\nVal'ast let the fabric fall from his hand. \"I thought I was Acrius reborn, claiming another sun for our kind.\" He gazed out the porthole. \"But I failed.\"\n\nCaiatl smiled. \"I've always loved that tale.\" She pulled a stool over and sat. \"Did you know that there used to be more to it?\"\n\nVal'ast shook his head.\n\n\"It's an older version, not as popular in modern times, but I was lucky enough to learn it as a child,\" the empress continued. \"Before Acrius, three warriors sought to climb a great mountain and grasp the sun, but a terrible beast stood in their way.\n\n\"The first tried to outwit the beast and sneak through the shadows, but the beast smelled him still and ate the warrior in a single bite.\n\n\"The second tried to escape the beast, crafting a device to harness the wind and soar upward. But the fickle wind changed its mind and tossed her into the beast's maw.\n\n\"The third warrior challenged the beast head on, Severus in hand. She also fell to the beast's gnashing teeth, but not before her blade tasted blood.\"\n\nVal'ast frowned. \"They all failed?\"\n\nCaiatl considered the question. \"The first two, certainly. They thought battle could be avoided. But the third warrior died with pride and honor.\"\n\nVal'ast pondered for a moment. \"Even in defeat, she left her mark on her foe.\"\n\nCaiatl nodded. \"And the next time one of her kin faced it, the beast would be one blow closer to death.\"\n\n\"Did more come?\" Val'ast questioned.\n\n\"Of course!\" Caiatl exclaimed. \"They were Cabal, and the sun was theirs to claim. Over and over, their mightiest fell. But each time, another wound was struck, until the day came when a warrior landed the final blow. That warrior was Acrius.\"\n\nVal'ast frowned. \"Ever since I was a child, I saw Acrius as a hero\u2026\"\n\n\"He may have been,\" Caiatl replied as she clasped Val'ast's hand in hers. \"But so was the warrior who struck first.\"\n\nVal'ast's eyed glistened as he held her grip firmly. \"Thank you, Empress.\"\n\nCaiatl shook her head. \"My brother, it is the empire who thanks you.\"",

He could see the route to safety. Dark crevasses tucked between tepui where he could run and hide. Where he knew he could survive.\n\n(Vatoc reloads his rifle and sings an oath to his empress.)\n\nHe had been a coward before, but no longer.",

                "ExtLore": "// Cryptarchy Analysis Log R11320 \u2014 Stolen Cabal Data //\n\n// Author \u2014 Master Rahool //\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWhat follows is a translation of a Cabal data file that was acquired as part of Operation Haystack, as ordered by Commander Zavala. This log focuses on a single file we were able to decrypt; for the full report on the contents of that data breach and further decryption attempts, please see log R11312.\n\nOstensibly, this file is a recipe for a dish to be served at some sort of official gathering in Caiatl's honor. The ingredients mentioned here have been seen in a variety of ancient Cabal texts, and analysis of the empire's economic history implies that they are considered cheap and undesirable. I believe this recipe is both old and born of the lower class, a case of poor laborers devising ingenious (yet challenging) ways to take unsold goods and turn them into something comforting and delicious. \n\nThat Caiatl chose this as a main dish for an official gathering speaks to the optics she wants to present; she may be trying to differentiate herself from the opulence of the Calus era and the utilitarianism of Ghaul's rule by relating to the common folk of the empire. \n\nNote that decryption was only mostly successful, and some data degradation occurred. Cryptarch's comments are in-line for ease of understanding. Some translations remain ambiguous, but I've provided my best hypotheses.\n\n// FILE START //\u2014 [CBX PARSER ERROR]\n\n\u2014 [CBX PARSER ERROR] \n\n\u2014 [CBX PARSER ERROR] until the solvent mixture has blended together.\n\n\u2014 Pulverize atlotl tendons until just pliable and surfaces begin to crack, then dredge in solvent mixture and let soak for [36\u201384 hours; the cycle referenced here is unknown, estimates are conservative guess].\n\n\u2014 To make the [black cube], crush citrus mixture, then drain through a sieve. Discard juice, retaining pulp and bitter pith. Compress solids in [kitchen vice? unsure of translation] on maximum heat until block is [CBX PARSER ERROR] to touch and charred.

Bring to boil, then add loin and tendons.
