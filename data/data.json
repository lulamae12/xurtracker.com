The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

My favorite\u2026\" Spider trails off with a drag of ether to select a title befitting the Drifter, \"\u2026nothing.\"\n\n\"You think this'll take?\" The Drifter says and nods skyward, kicking an empty ether canister off the side of their floating mote of Reef. Red streaks burn in the star-sea sky beyond the vast cloud of asteroids and dust, drawing the shape of a new constellation as the Warmind launches fresh guns.\n\n\"An 'almighty' effort. Splendid.\" Spider steps off a transit craft, alone. \"We could have met in\u2026 a more protected place.\"\n\n\"You don't like being seen with me?\"\n\n\"The Spider is a friend to all, but not all my friends are friends,\" Spider says and focuses his gaze on the Drifter. \"You should have come to me.\"\n\n\"You keep too many bodies around. Bodies can stab you in the back.\"\n\n\"Running shows your back,\" the Spider's voice shudders, \"to everyone.\"\n\nDrifter pauses a moment and looks around at the desolate scape. Small boulders hang in space. They slowly drift towards each other, make contact, and bounce away on random trajectories. Some stick; incorporated via destructive consummation. He scowls and turns back to Spider. \"Stretch your legs. No one here for miles.\"\n\nThe Spider unfurls himself, slurping a heavy vacuumous drag from his rebreather. Fully upright, he dwarfs the Drifter in shadow. \"Isolation\u2026 is not the same as protection, friend.\"\n\n\"Friendship gonna save us from what's coming?\" Drifter asks. He places his fingertips together, the space between his hands resembling a triangle.\n\n\"The odds aren't in your favor, but\u2026\" a guttural laugh ripples from Spider's belly and sends vibration through the loose-packed dirt underfoot, \"I'm the wrong one to come to for comfort.\"\n\n\"I get it. You tried running last time. Didn't work. Now you're trying to hide. Let me give you some advice: that don't work either.\"\n\n\"Hiding? the Spider asks and waits. \"The board changes. The board clears. I don't play, I just price the pieces.\"\n\n\"Cold-blooded. World's ending and you want a run at it for all it's got.\"\n\n\"'End' is a matter of perspective. Devastation is oftentimes,\" he says with a breath, \"profitable.\"\n\n\"What if nothing's left? Skin and bones?\"\n\n\"There's always ivory among the bones.\"\n\n\"Bull.\"\n\nSpider slings a single breathy, \"Ha.\"\n\n\"You remind me of my compatriots.\" Spider wraps his fingers around a small clod of earth drifting by. \"They looked at the Whirlwind, just like you. Scared.\" He closes his hand, crushing the clod into a dense mound. It fractures into several pieces that waft away as Spider releases his grip. \"But here we are, living on anyway.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Fallen.\"\n\n\"Fallen. I hold favor among Witches, and Kells, and whispering agents\u2026 of every shade and shape. My web is vast, and I have proven useful. Let the kings bloody each other. I'll direct the runoff.\"\n\n\"You talking about Guardians? Hate to break it to you, but they're a cheap date.\"\n\n\"Cheap is malleable. Cheap becomes\u2026 cheaper in desperation.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" The Drifter pulls a small and ornate box of Awoken design from his rucksack. \"Who you lookin' for with this anyway?\"\n\nThe Spider steps toward Drifter, smothering his personal space. \"Options, my dear rogue; tangled in the web.\" He takes the box with his dominant arms and plops two stuffed sacks of Ghost shells into the Drifter's hands with his others.\n\n\"Went through hell to get that little box. Don't come with no throne,\" Drifter says, holding his voice steady, jaw tense to stay the trembling.\n\nThe Spider chitters as a shiver runs through him. \"No. Just a looking-glass window. Good business, friend.\" The hulking Fallen Don turns to leave. \"Remember\u2026 remain useful.\"\n\n\"When you find 'em, you sure the past won't come knocking?\"\n\n\"No one minds the Spider.\"\n\n\"Lucky.\"",

The risks taken and the boundaries pushed to keep herself entertained and her Worm fed.\n\nBefore\u2026 \n\nOsiris stumbles as he walks through the Last City. Beneath his robes, something erupts in a frenzy of motion. He pauses to compose himself and then walks on, trailing careless spatters of black fluid.\n\nBefore\u2026\n\nOsiris watches the Crucible match unfold. He does not cheer for either opponent.

His Light flares as he draws his weapon with impossible speed.\n\nShe has only a moment: She pushes her face down through the ropes, opens her mouth, and sings. \n\nThe man stops, then slowly holsters his weapon. He turns, crosses his arms, and forgets. \n\nShe melts awkwardly back into the skull as best she can, though a tangle of spindly elbows, licorice-black, still juts from its sockets. She turns her attention to her quarry across the gap and hums her song softly to mask herself. \n\nSoon, the man below begins to hum along with her.\n\nShe smiles.",
