Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

                "ExtLore": "Siegfried's feet touch down on a metal grate ten fathoms deep into the Leviathan, where snaking tunnels split into many different directions. The room is large, empty, and dark. He cycles through the night vision and thermal imaging on his helm, then looks up to his fireteam.\n\nHe can see the shimmering Eliksni camouflage distort the shapes of his seven teammates as they descend the shaft above him on a carbon-weave line. He disables his own. In front of him sits the base of a robotic construct in the likeness of Calus. It is twice his height, and the bare mechanisms of its internal workings creak with age.\n\nFour Cabal Legionaries, two Eliksni Splicers, and a Praxic Sunsinger drop in behind Siegfried and deactivate their cloaks. The Splicers get to work establishing a connection with the automaton while the Legionaries make a perimeter at their back. Siegfried stands with them.\n\nThe Warlock does not take their eyes from the automaton.\n\n\"Splice\u2026 formed.\" One of the Eliksni turns to the Warlock and nods. The Warlock steps forward\u2014\n\n\"Thieves skulking through my Leviathan!\" The automaton bellows with Calus's voice and forcibly bats away a Splicer with a metallic hand. They crash into the adjacent wall and crumple into unconsciousness. The second Splicer leaps back and takes cover behind a Legionary as the Praxic Warlock unleashes a volley of celestial fire into the construct's face. In response, a steely fist bursts through the fire-smoke and crushes the Warlock into the floor.\n\nSiegfried turns toward the Legionaries and shouts, \"Contact!\"\n\nThe Cabal open up with slug rifles; munitions clang against the thick metal. The remaining Splicer aims for the construct's exposed machinery with their Arc pistol.\n\nSiegfried rushes forward, sliding to meet the automaton head on. He ignites in Solar flame and shoulder charges the construct into the chamber wall. He rolls under a retaliating fist and grabs the automaton's chassis, wrestling to spin its back to his fireteam.\n\nThe Sunsinger gasps, alive again. They grab the unconscious Eliksni and take a position amid the Legionaries, shouting, \"CONCENTRATE FIRE!\"\n\nWith one swift motion, the Praxic Warlock combusts brilliantly with Solar Radiance that emboldens the firing line of Cabal shooters and fills the Splicer's heart with courage. Heated slugs puncture and the Arc pistol finds its mark, shorting out one of the automaton's exposed knees.\n\nSlug rifles shred the construct's face as it crashes to the ground and frenetically crawls toward them, tearing metal from the floor with each scraping motion.\n\nThe Titan raises a hand, and in a burst of fiery might, summons a Devastator's maul. He brings the maul down into the automaton's back, demolishing it and sending molten shrapnel skidding across the floor.\n\nSiegfried looks to the Sunsinger, then the rest of the fireteam. \"Contact down\u2026 let's keep going.\"",

She did not return as\u2026 herself.\" Tuk'rin's eyes are lost for a moment in the sights he has seen. \"She was a noble Cabal, but the spirits attacked her mind that night, and she turned this cannon on us.\"\n\nHis soldiers silently contemplate his claim.\n\nTuk'rin continues, \"It was my kill, so now it's my command.

Every creak and groan of his throne becomes excruciatingly pronounced. Spider reclines against one arm, rolling a dead Ghost's shell in one hand, scraping a clawed finger across its gray, lifeless eye. The arrival of a trusted associate pulls Spider from his thoughts. \n\n\"Avrok,\" Spider bellows, turning his attention to the armored Eliksni striding through the doorway, \"what did you find?\" \n\nAvrok approaches Spider's throne, wringing his hands together anxiously. \"Our thief, my lord.\" \n\nSpider leans forward with a groan of the cables suspending his throne. \"And what did you do to them?\" he asks in greedy anticipation. That, however, is where Avrok falters. \n\n\"I did not\u2026 catch them, my lord,\" Avrok humbly answers, his much smaller frame eclipsed in Spider's shadow. \"But I have a name.\" \n\n\"Out with it,\" Spider grouses, falling back against his throne with deflated interest. \n\n\"The Crow.\" \n\nSpider's blood turns to fire. His grip tightens on that dead Ghost so hard its shell cracks. Spider continues squeezing it until the glass eye completely pops. \n\nThen he takes a moment to compose himself. \n\n\"Our little bird, come home to the nest so soon? Tell me everything.\" \n\n\"He was able to infiltrate the storehouse,\" Avrok explains, \"and coerced a team of laborers to offload cargo promised to the empress onto a Skiff, which he then\u2026 stole. Along with a cache of your more\u2014ah\u2014personal belongings, among which was the quantum opal.\" \n\n Avrok shrinks lower, lower, lower. \"The supplies were delivered to Mithrax. In your name. As a gift.\" \n\n\"And the workers?\" Spider growls. \n\n\"They are gone?\" Avrok doesn't mean to make it sound like a question, and regrets taking the tone immediately. \n\n\"To where, exactly?\" \n\n\"They\u2026\" Avrok takes a small step back from Spider's throne. \"Left.\" He clenches his jaws. \"With the Crow.\" \n\nSpider slowly leans forward again. \n\n\"For Earth,\" Avrok concludes. \n\nThe Ether pipes begin to hum and rattle as a new batch begins production elsewhere in the complex. The noises rise in intensity, turning into the familiar hissing wail that joins with the uncomfortable sound of Spider. Laughing. \n\nThe Baron of the Shore throws his dead Ghost at Avrok who ducks away from it, covering his head with his hands. \n\n\"He's taking them to Mithrax,\" Spider says between fitful chuckles and wheezing coughs. \"He steals\u2014from me\u2014and gives it to the House of Light? Unbelievable.\" Though behind the laughter and coughs, there is a hint of appreciation in his tone. \"The kid's grown a spine.\" \n\n\"There is,\" Avrok starts, offering Spider a folded piece of paper, \"one more thing. He left this behind.\" Spider's seal is scribbled on one side. \"For you.\" \n\nAs Spider unfolds the note, Avrok creeps further away from the throne. Inside is nothing more than a crude drawing and a rude missive. \n\n \"That little sh\u2014 \"\n\nThe pipes are howling.",

The Shadow partook with the stamina of a great Cabal primus, but the rogue ate even better, so well that even the generous Emperor, watching through his Shadow's eyes, was impressed.\n\nFinally, the last course was served: a flaky pastry the size of a human's fist. The rogue bit into it, and winced at the crunch, for the pastry was filled with metal and paint and the taste of vanilla.\n\nThe rogue ate it all.\n\nThen, wiping his lips, the rogue asked what was in the pastry. And the Shadow told him: \"Your Ghost.\"\n\nAnd before he could respond, the Shadow leapt up and, seizing more food and drink, forced it upon the rogue called Dredgen Hope in such generous quantities that the rogue could not endure his own gratitude. Thus was the rogue's hunger sated.",

The Shadow of Earth slew him, but spared his hateful little companion-soul so that the well of pleasure that was Uldren's death should never run dry.\n\nSo many times did the Shadow of Earth slay the one called Uldren Sov that no chronicler could ever record the exact number. At last, when the Shadow's appetite was whetted, Uldren Sov met his final death.",
