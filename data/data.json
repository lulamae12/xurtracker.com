The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

It's not because I don't know my answer, but because I want to feel like I still doubt it. I raise my head. Gaelin meets my eyes and looks up to the canopy.\n\nHe leans his shoulder into me and drops his voice to a whisper. \"My Clip's  a good one, but you need to realize Ghosts don't know anything.

If you think something's coming unwound, you need to sit down and talk it out.\"\n\n\"Wait\u2026 did Clip change yo\u2014\"\n\n\"Please,\" Gaelin scoffs. \"You're paranoid.\" He turns to keep walking and calls back, \"Life changes you.

We continue walking.\n\n\"What'd you name the beast?\"\n\n\"Castus.\"\n\n\"You've been reading too many of the Spider's books .\"\n\n\"Some of 'em are good.\"\n\nI laugh. \"Aren't you the man that said anything you got tying you down can be made into a noose?\"\n\n\"Yeah, some time ago.\"\n\n\"You've been taking a lot of jobs with him ?

A haphazard collision of heavy canvas and metallic weave draped over its shoulders. A Vanguard lanyard dangled absurdly from its neck. \n\nIt was small for an Eliksni, but its angular head still towered above Maurice as it hunched over the bar. Four blue eyes looked back at him from above a lipless mouth. It opened, revealing rows of thin, sharp teeth. \n\n\"One item ramen soup,\" the Eliksni croaked stiltedly. \"Please.\" \n\nMaurice held his breath, tightened his grip on his pencil, and grinned. He grinned when he was nervous, and this seemed like as good a time as any. \n\nThe Eliksni grinned back, nodded, and then opened its horrible mouth again. \"I smelled it, and the smell was good,\" it said.\n\nMaurice scanned the bar. His other customers sat frozen, their bowls of ramen steaming silently in front of them. He realized his mouth had apparently decided to talk on its own, as if nothing were wrong. He heard himself ask, \"How spicy, zero to five stars?\"\n\nThe Eliksni had anticipated this question. \"Spicy five stars,\" it said, holding up one hand with three claws splayed, and another with two. \"May I receive additional dead flesh, please?\"\n\n\"You got it,\" Maurice said, his even voice betraying none of his tension, and he turned back to the bubbling pot of broth. Muscle memory took over, and he soon found himself placing a steaming bowl of ramen in front of the creature, who clucked cheerfully.\n\nMaurice took a half-step back. A small crowd was forming in the walkway in front of the restaurant. Some of the customers leaned in as their curiosity overcame their terror. Maurice noticed the woman in seat 2 needed more water, but it could wait. \n\nThe Eliksni raised its arms tentatively, then looked to Maurice again. \"What is the protocol?\" \n\nMaurice found himself unsure of which pair of the Eliksni's eyes to look into and focused on the ramen instead. \"Well, you eat the noodles and pork and egg with\u2014\" \n\n\"Egg,\" repeated the Eliksni, enjoying the unfamiliar word.\n\n\"\u2014yeah, egg. You eat all that with the chopsticks, and you get the broth with the spoon.\" Maurice saw how the Eliksni's claws dwarfed the ceramic spoon. \"Or you can just lift the whole bowl and drink it.\"\n\nMaurice mimed lifting a bowl to his lips. The Eliksni nodded. Its claws tapped the metal on its face and the hissing blue mist ceased. \n\nThe Eliksni held the chopsticks, tested their weight, and respectfully placed them back on the bar before bringing the bowl to its mouth with its upper arms. Above the ramen bowl, Maurice saw all four of the Eliksni's eyes close. \n\nA long moment of tension fell over the shop, the silence broken only by a staccato series of hissing slurps.\n\nFinally, the Eliksni lowered the empty bowl. It breathed in as the blue mist resumed its thin spray. It looked toward Maurice. \"I tasted all of it,\" it said with deep satisfaction. \"I am very thankful.\"\n\nMaurice's grin turned into a tentative smile. \"Glad you enjoyed it.\" \n\nThe Eliksni stood and held out what looked like a small model of the Traveler. It glowed as it floated in the Eliksni's palm. \"Compensation,\" it said.\n\nMaurice reached to take the treasure, then drew his hand back. \"For new customers, there is no charge,\" he said. \"No compensation. Thank you for coming in.\" \n\nThe Eliksni cocked its head, then clucked and the model vanished beneath the folds of its cloak. It smiled at Maurice. \n\n\"You,\" it said, then cleared its throat with a rumble, \"you are a\u2014\" and the five spirited words that followed were replete with hard consonants. \n\nIn the confused silence that followed, the Eliksni nodded graciously, then walked through the crowd outside and deeper into the City.",

She did not return as\u2026 herself.\" Tuk'rin's eyes are lost for a moment in the sights he has seen. \"She was a noble Cabal, but the spirits attacked her mind that night, and she turned this cannon on us.\"\n\nHis soldiers silently contemplate his claim.\n\nTuk'rin continues, \"It was my kill, so now it's my command.

Just his speed. \n\nConstruction Redjacks had pulled the pistol from the build site of the H.E.L.M. Some of their deeper combat coding must have kicked in, because they brought the piece to him directly. Banshee wondered how long this beauty had been stuck in the rubble. Hell, maybe it was buried there intentionally. Evidence of some evil deed from way back. \n\nWell, any dirt on this hardware was long forgotten by now. Banshee set to disassembling the gun, his hands working faster than the eye could follow. In just a few seconds, he had it in constituent parts on his bench. He scanned the surface of each component, looking for the maker's mark. \n\nThere! A tiny inscription on the trigger pin. Almost imperceptible, even to his digital eyes. He examined the pin through his loupe. The mark read \"B-44.4.C-6\". Seemed like a part number. Guess he'd never know who crafted it. \n\nIt really was a helluva piece, though. Whoever made it had a real eye for the game. \n\nWherever you came from, he thought, it's time to find you a new home.",
