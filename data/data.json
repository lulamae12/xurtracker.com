Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Lakshmi, Project Stronghold will require additional printings. Ada-1 has agreed to lend her equipment and expertise to assist in this endeavor. Is this satisfactory?\n\nFWC-L2: Our forges are ready and eager. We request to assist the Bray in evaluating damage to the Warmind.\n\nCZ: Offer the help.

Those at the back surged forward recklessly for a better view, while those in front struggled against the swell, afraid of being pushed into the path of the gladiators' swords. Audience casualties were common at such affairs.\n\nTagh'al suddenly broke the stalemate with a massive cleave, aimed at his opponent's helmeted head. Thagh'urn sidestepped it with ease. His ferocious counter-slice raked across Tagh'al's armored breastplate, leaving a thick gouge in the metal. The crowd roared.\n\nFor several minutes, the massive warriors clashed. Their swords clanged in fury, scraping off one another's armor. All the while, the crowd's furor grew, held in suspense by the certainty of bloodshed.\n\nThen it happened. As the two Cabal locked blades, Thagh'urn unholstered a concealed submachine gun. He unleashed a burst of small caliber bullets into Tagh'al's abdomen at point-blank range, sending the warrior staggering backward. Those who had bet on Tagh'al howled in indignation.\n\nTagh'al pulled off his breastplate to reveal several bullet holes in his thick hide, a gout of blood spurting from one of the wounds. He looked down at the damage\u2026\n\n\u2026And let out a deep, barking laugh. Thagh'urn joined in, and soon, both gladiators were laughing uproariously amidst a spreading pool of blood.\n\nEventually, Tagh'al's laugh slowed to a chuckle. \"Well played, brother,\" he said. \"I suppose we're even now.\"",

She catalogues the embellishments on a data-pad, noting the similarities before continuing her examination, confident in her initial findings regarding a link to the Crown.\n\nA link to the Crown.

Hell, you've walked by it before, Moondust.\"\n\n\"What wonders you must have buried in this heap,\" Eris muses. The emerald shine of her eyes dart back and forth behind thin cloth.\n\"I could\u2026\" Drifter saunters up beside her, \"give you the tour?\"\n\n\"We haven't the time. Tell me, what have you learned from this egregore sample?\"\n\nDrifter wrinkles his face and looks up to the massive, contained growth. \"Uhh\u2026\"\n\nEris massages annoyance from her brow. She sees the playful coyness in his eyes. The hidden information he holds as bargain for some trade. \"Do you at least remember where you found it?\"\n\n\"Sister, you don't wanna know.\" Eris locks her eyes on the Drifter's face. He staggers back awkwardly and shrugs. \"Icy little nothing in the middle of nowhere. Doesn't have a name, and you don't want to go there alone.\"\n\n\"But you could take me?\" Eris tests his defenses.\n\nDrifter brushes off the mottled fur of his shoulder guards and leans against a poorly fastened railing. \"Only if we take your jumpship. And I drive.\"\n\nEris sighs and pushes through him. \"No.\"\n\nDrifter springs after her. \"So that's it? You're leaving?\"\n\n\"You're being evasive, Rat.\" Eris plucks her Ahamkara bone from his hand and stows it beneath her cloak. \"Contact me when you're willing to speak plainly.\"\n\nDrifter calls after her, hands outstretched, \"You don't want to stay for dinner?\"\n\nEris halts, considering what disgusting amalgamation of refuse would constitute a meal here. She glances over her shoulder. One last attempt to extract information\u2026\n\n\"It is strange. When Savath\u00fbn drew Mars back into our space, it was free of the egregore. But the Glykon and Leviathan both returned rampant with fungal growth. Why?\" she asks.\n\nHe gives in. \"You know\u2026 it sings if you burn it just right.\" Drifter thumbs behind him. \"Sub-sonic, resonates in a funny way with Pyramid tech.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\n\"You don't trust me?\"",

What are you?\" Drifter points at the thing with distrust.\n\n\"Leave it be. The Ziggurat awaits our experiment,\" Eris says, saddling a mostly materialized Sparrow and blasting off into the snow across the frozen Europan flats.\n\n\"\u2026And don't touch my stuff!\" She hears Drifter shout at the thing as he follows after her.\n\nFrigid sleet stings Eris's face red atop the Ziggurat. It is a welcome sensation compared to the prickling numbness that sticks her fingers; she grips a harvested stalk of the egregore fungus tightly in one gloved hand. In the other, a hot flare disgorges plumes of jade smoke.\n\nShe lights the stalk at both ends, according to the Drifter's instruction. Ashing spores furl into dense clouds that envelop her body, obscuring her sight in soot-black shroud until it blocks out all else.\n\nFaint whispers.\n\nA choral swell through turbulent winds.\n\nTone that forms words across the surface of her mind.\n\n\"You hear it?\" Drifter asks, his voice a whisper outside her awareness.\n\nThe Ziggurat resonates like a tuning fork. The vibrations themselves take shape within the smoke, and Eris is drawn toward somewhere distant and empty. She follows, and the smoke swirls with points of color like stars, separated by lonely rifts of black expanse. Echoes radiate from the black deep like graviton ripples through space. They wash distortion over the stars until breaking against four other points\u2014two greater, two weaker\u2014ghostly strands of incorporeal egregore between them.\n\nShe then sees the Pyramids of Europa, Luna, and Savath\u00fbn's throne world\u2014as one, their structures melded and overlapping. The connections cauterize in her mind like a vivid memory.\n\nEris blinks, and the sensation is gone. The stalk is ash in her hand.",

Eris's ship purrs next to it in contrast.\n\n\"There is a connection between the points of Darkness. Signals passing back and forth to something beyond.\" Eris steps closer so her voice carries over the engine noise. \"The other Pyramids may provide more context.\"\n\nThe Drifter clicks his tongue and raises and eyebrow. \"Sounds a mite dangerous with big daddy Calus parking right over the Moon? Seems off limits.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the Guardian leads raiding parties into Rhulk's Pyramid in Savath\u00fbn's throne world. We will use that distraction.\"\n\nAnd with that, Eris shoulders through him and trudges to her ship. \"Come, Rat.\"\n\n\"\u2026Can we eat first?\"\n\n*** \n\nExplosions thunder within the throne world's Pyramid as Eris and Drifter establish a camp in the sunken bog where Miasma meets the Pyramid's approach. The massive ship eclipses them, towering in fog, the extent of its edges unknown to their eyes.\n\nDrifter's face is stern, clenched with a tension Eris has seldom seen: Trust in one hand, fist full of Stasis in the other.\n\nEris sets a cloth-wrapped stalk of egregore upon a pyramid-shard jutting from the stinking swamp. She unwraps and neatly spreads the corners of the cloth before noticing the Drifter's footsteps behind her.\n\n\"Somethin's watchin' us,\" Drifter mutters. He turns to his altered Ghost and whispers softly enough to convince himself that Eris cannot hear him, \"Keep your eye on her, eh?\" Then louder, \"I'm gonna look around, make sure that hotshot hero didn't miss any Screebs.\"\n\nThe Drifter's altered Ghost emits a single elongated tone in acknowledgement and then focuses on Eris.\n\n\"Germaine.\"\n\nHe stops. Eris knows his concern belies a nobility that he often attempts to suppress in favor of the persona of the Drifter. It is a ruddy shield, but she has seen the true him hidden under that that layer of grime.\n\n\"May I\u2026 have a light?\"\n\n\"You got it.\" He discharges a Solar round from his Trust that sparks on the Pyramid floor and ignites the egregore stalk. \"Back in a flash.\"\n\nEris watches him disappear into the swamp, then focuses on the pluming egregore.\n\n***\n\nEris sits, exhausted, on a warm cushion in the dirt. The Drifter stands over a hazardously large fire, scooping some sweet-smelling funk of a stew from a cauldron-like vessel of Hive design. Her face scrunches as he places a chunky bowl of thick greyish-brown potage in her hands.\n\n\"What'd you find?\" Drifter asks, slurping from his bowl.\n\nEris tests the temperature and flavor of this \"food\" against her lips. It is something like the stinking brined cheeses Ikora had given her on her last visit to the City, but with earthy depth beneath. Her face curls and she opts instead for conversation. \"I was right; they are connected. But now, I only have more questions.\"\n\n\"You ask me, that's how these things go. Better leave well enough alone and head home,\" Drifter says, slurping another mouthful.\n\n\"The egregore connects points of Darkness, resonates with Pyramid constructs, but I cannot decipher their communications. Still\u2026 the Lunar Pyramid, the Europan Pyramid, and both Glykon and Leviathan all converse with the same distant point. What Rhulk spoke to, so does Calus. It is\u2026 gravely concerning.\"\n\n\"Wild,\" Drifter says with a whistle. He shakes his head and looks at her full bowl. \"You gonna eat that?\"\n\n\"I\u2026\" Eris wonders if he heard her correctly but knows repeating herself is an exercise in futility. \"\u2026What is this? Exactly?\"\n\n\"Pretty damn tasty is what it is. First time I got it right. Thought you'd appreciate someone cooking for you since you, uh\u2026 well, you're awful at it.\"\n\n\"Rat, what are you feeding me?\" She remembers his hunt earlier in the day, and her stomach turns. Eris stares at the Drifter, mouth agape in a half-heaved gag\u2014her thoughts racing over the things he's claimed to have consumed. \"You cooked me rotted Screebs.\"\n\n\"What?!\" Drifter chokes on the stew and coughs. \"I wouldn't feed you that crap, Moondust.\" He laughs. \"You never had crawdad stew?\" He holds his bowl to his lips. \"Or a close cousin to it\u2026\" he adds under his breath. \"Little swamp shrimps, you dig? It's a delicacy!\"\n\nEris reels her imagination in, takes a breath, and sips the broth without taking her eyes from the Drifter. The liquid fills her crumpled stomach with hearty warmth. She feels her stress melt away. The stew's flavor is far more pleasing than its smell. She smiles and drinks again.\n\n\"Thank you. It is\u2026 good.\"",

It is a welcome sensation compared to the prickling numbness that sticks her fingers; she grips a harvested stalk of the egregore fungus tightly in one gloved hand. In the other, a hot flare disgorges plumes of jade smoke.\n\nShe lights the stalk at both ends, according to the Drifter's instruction. Ashing spores furl into dense clouds that envelop her body, obscuring her sight in soot-black shroud until it blocks out all else.\n\nFaint whispers.\n\nA choral swell through turbulent winds.\n\nTone that forms words across the surface of her mind.\n\n\"You hear it?\" Drifter asks, his voice a whisper outside her awareness.\n\nThe Ziggurat resonates like a tuning fork. The vibrations themselves take shape within the smoke, and Eris is drawn toward somewhere distant and empty. She follows, and the smoke swirls with points of color like stars, separated by lonely rifts of black expanse. Echoes radiate from the black deep like graviton ripples through space. They wash distortion over the stars until breaking against four other points\u2014two greater, two weaker\u2014ghostly strands of incorporeal egregore between them.\n\nShe then sees the Pyramids of Europa, Luna, and Savath\u00fbn's throne world\u2014as one, their structures melded and overlapping. The connections cauterize in her mind like a vivid memory.\n\nEris blinks, and the sensation is gone. The stalk is ash in her hand.",

Eris's ship purrs next to it in contrast.\n\n\"There is a connection between the points of Darkness. Signals passing back and forth to something beyond.\" Eris steps closer so her voice carries over the engine noise. \"The other Pyramids may provide more context.\"\n\nThe Drifter clicks his tongue and raises and eyebrow. \"Sounds a mite dangerous with big daddy Calus parking right over the Moon? Seems off limits.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the Guardian leads raiding parties into Rhulk's Pyramid in Savath\u00fbn's throne world. We will use that distraction.\"\n\nAnd with that, Eris shoulders through him and trudges to her ship. \"Come, Rat.\"\n\n\"\u2026Can we eat first?\"\n\n*** \n\nExplosions thunder within the throne world's Pyramid as Eris and Drifter establish a camp in the sunken bog where Miasma meets the Pyramid's approach. The massive ship eclipses them, towering in fog, the extent of its edges unknown to their eyes.\n\nDrifter's face is stern, clenched with a tension Eris has seldom seen: Trust in one hand, fist full of Stasis in the other.\n\nEris sets a cloth-wrapped stalk of egregore upon a pyramid-shard jutting from the stinking swamp. She unwraps and neatly spreads the corners of the cloth before noticing the Drifter's footsteps behind her.\n\n\"Somethin's watchin' us,\" Drifter mutters. He turns to his altered Ghost and whispers softly enough to convince himself that Eris cannot hear him, \"Keep your eye on her, eh?\" Then louder, \"I'm gonna look around, make sure that hotshot hero didn't miss any Screebs.\"\n\nThe Drifter's altered Ghost emits a single elongated tone in acknowledgement and then focuses on Eris.\n\n\"Germaine.\"\n\nHe stops. Eris knows his concern belies a nobility that he often attempts to suppress in favor of the persona of the Drifter. It is a ruddy shield, but she has seen the true him hidden under that that layer of grime.\n\n\"May I\u2026 have a light?\"\n\n\"You got it.\" He discharges a Solar round from his Trust that sparks on the Pyramid floor and ignites the egregore stalk. \"Back in a flash.\"\n\nEris watches him disappear into the swamp, then focuses on the pluming egregore.\n\n***\n\nEris sits, exhausted, on a warm cushion in the dirt. The Drifter stands over a hazardously large fire, scooping some sweet-smelling funk of a stew from a cauldron-like vessel of Hive design. Her face scrunches as he places a chunky bowl of thick greyish-brown potage in her hands.\n\n\"What'd you find?\" Drifter asks, slurping from his bowl.\n\nEris tests the temperature and flavor of this \"food\" against her lips. It is something like the stinking brined cheeses Ikora had given her on her last visit to the City, but with earthy depth beneath. Her face curls and she opts instead for conversation. \"I was right; they are connected. But now, I only have more questions.\"\n\n\"You ask me, that's how these things go. Better leave well enough alone and head home,\" Drifter says, slurping another mouthful.\n\n\"The egregore connects points of Darkness, resonates with Pyramid constructs, but I cannot decipher their communications. Still\u2026 the Lunar Pyramid, the Europan Pyramid, and both Glykon and Leviathan all converse with the same distant point. What Rhulk spoke to, so does Calus. It is\u2026 gravely concerning.\"\n\n\"Wild,\" Drifter says with a whistle. He shakes his head and looks at her full bowl. \"You gonna eat that?\"\n\n\"I\u2026\" Eris wonders if he heard her correctly but knows repeating herself is an exercise in futility. \"\u2026What is this? Exactly?\"\n\n\"Pretty damn tasty is what it is. First time I got it right. Thought you'd appreciate someone cooking for you since you, uh\u2026 well, you're awful at it.\"\n\n\"Rat, what are you feeding me?\" She remembers his hunt earlier in the day, and her stomach turns. Eris stares at the Drifter, mouth agape in a half-heaved gag\u2014her thoughts racing over the things he's claimed to have consumed. \"You cooked me rotted Screebs.\"\n\n\"What?!\" Drifter chokes on the stew and coughs. \"I wouldn't feed you that crap, Moondust.\" He laughs. \"You never had crawdad stew?\" He holds his bowl to his lips. \"Or a close cousin to it\u2026\" he adds under his breath. \"Little swamp shrimps, you dig? It's a delicacy!\"\n\nEris reels her imagination in, takes a breath, and sips the broth without taking her eyes from the Drifter. The liquid fills her crumpled stomach with hearty warmth. She feels her stress melt away. The stew's flavor is far more pleasing than its smell. She smiles and drinks again.\n\n\"Thank you. It is\u2026 good.\"",

An ornately dressed Warlock thanatonaut follows, their robes trimmed in bone and elaborately stitched symbols.\n\n\"Did you commandeer this from Mars?\" Ikora asks with a smile, looking over the Hive vessel.\n\nEris stands. \"It provided ample shielding for transporting the Crown from its vault.\"\n\n\"It's here, now?\" the thanatonaut asks, breaking his stride at the bottom of the stairs.\n\n\"Worry not. The H.E.L.M. will disembark from the City to ensure the Crown is contained,\" Eris answers.\n\n\"Keep that Tomb Ship docked here in case we need to jettison the Crown. Last thing I need is a rookie shooting you down in it.\" Ikora steps past the thanatonaut with a reassuring nod. \"Tell us what you're thinking next, Eris.\"\n\nEris gestures toward the open bay door. \"The Leviathan is at our doorstep. Even if we unravel Calus's plan, the ship itself still poses a threat simply by its size. Calus does not require paracausal power to cause an extinction-level event.\"\n\n\"Calus's interest appears to be focused solely on the Pyramid,\" Ikora interjects. \"Should that change, Zavala assures me that Caiatl's fleet will provide ample dissuasive firepower.\"\n\nEris nods in rhythm with Ikora's well-reasoned words. \"I trust that to be true\u2014however, whatever connection Calus has established is drawing Nightmares and phantoms alike to the Leviathan. He is able to exert influence over them. But I believe we can disrupt this connection.\"\n\nShe points to the thanatonaut. \"You,\" she says and motions toward three chalked spots on the floor. \"Here, here, and here.

The Ziggurat awaits our experiment,\" Eris says, saddling a mostly materialized Sparrow and blasting off into the snow across the frozen Europan flats.\n\n\"\u2026And don't touch my stuff!\" She hears Drifter shout at the thing as he follows after her.\n\nFrigid sleet stings Eris's face red atop the Ziggurat. It is a welcome sensation compared to the prickling numbness that sticks her fingers; she grips a harvested stalk of the egregore fungus tightly in one gloved hand. In the other, a hot flare disgorges plumes of jade smoke.\n\nShe lights the stalk at both ends, according to the Drifter's instruction. Ashing spores furl into dense clouds that envelop her body, obscuring her sight in soot-black shroud until it blocks out all else.\n\nFaint whispers.\n\nA choral swell through turbulent winds.\n\nTone that forms words across the surface of her mind.\n\n\"You hear it?\" Drifter asks, his voice a whisper outside her awareness.\n\nThe Ziggurat resonates like a tuning fork. The vibrations themselves take shape within the smoke, and Eris is drawn toward somewhere distant and empty. She follows, and the smoke swirls with points of color like stars, separated by lonely rifts of black expanse. Echoes radiate from the black deep like graviton ripples through space. They wash distortion over the stars until breaking against four other points\u2014two greater, two weaker\u2014ghostly strands of incorporeal egregore between them.\n\nShe then sees the Pyramids of Europa, Luna, and Savath\u00fbn's throne world\u2014as one, their structures melded and overlapping. The connections cauterize in her mind like a vivid memory.\n\nEris blinks, and the sensation is gone. The stalk is ash in her hand.",

                "ExtLore": "\"You want to go where?\" Drifter's jumpship idles roughly behind him, the engine misfiring and clattering loudly as if ready to explode. Eris's ship purrs next to it in contrast.\n\n\"There is a connection between the points of Darkness. Signals passing back and forth to something beyond.\" Eris steps closer so her voice carries over the engine noise. \"The other Pyramids may provide more context.\"\n\nThe Drifter clicks his tongue and raises and eyebrow. \"Sounds a mite dangerous with big daddy Calus parking right over the Moon? Seems off limits.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the Guardian leads raiding parties into Rhulk's Pyramid in Savath\u00fbn's throne world. We will use that distraction.\"\n\nAnd with that, Eris shoulders through him and trudges to her ship. \"Come, Rat.\"\n\n\"\u2026Can we eat first?\"\n\n*** \n\nExplosions thunder within the throne world's Pyramid as Eris and Drifter establish a camp in the sunken bog where Miasma meets the Pyramid's approach. The massive ship eclipses them, towering in fog, the extent of its edges unknown to their eyes.\n\nDrifter's face is stern, clenched with a tension Eris has seldom seen: Trust in one hand, fist full of Stasis in the other.\n\nEris sets a cloth-wrapped stalk of egregore upon a pyramid-shard jutting from the stinking swamp. She unwraps and neatly spreads the corners of the cloth before noticing the Drifter's footsteps behind her.\n\n\"Somethin's watchin' us,\" Drifter mutters. He turns to his altered Ghost and whispers softly enough to convince himself that Eris cannot hear him, \"Keep your eye on her, eh?\" Then louder, \"I'm gonna look around, make sure that hotshot hero didn't miss any Screebs.\"\n\nThe Drifter's altered Ghost emits a single elongated tone in acknowledgement and then focuses on Eris.\n\n\"Germaine.\"\n\nHe stops. Eris knows his concern belies a nobility that he often attempts to suppress in favor of the persona of the Drifter. It is a ruddy shield, but she has seen the true him hidden under that that layer of grime.\n\n\"May I\u2026 have a light?\"\n\n\"You got it.\" He discharges a Solar round from his Trust that sparks on the Pyramid floor and ignites the egregore stalk. \"Back in a flash.\"\n\nEris watches him disappear into the swamp, then focuses on the pluming egregore.\n\n***\n\nEris sits, exhausted, on a warm cushion in the dirt. The Drifter stands over a hazardously large fire, scooping some sweet-smelling funk of a stew from a cauldron-like vessel of Hive design. Her face scrunches as he places a chunky bowl of thick greyish-brown potage in her hands.\n\n\"What'd you find?\" Drifter asks, slurping from his bowl.\n\nEris tests the temperature and flavor of this \"food\" against her lips. It is something like the stinking brined cheeses Ikora had given her on her last visit to the City, but with earthy depth beneath. Her face curls and she opts instead for conversation. \"I was right; they are connected. But now, I only have more questions.\"\n\n\"You ask me, that's how these things go. Better leave well enough alone and head home,\" Drifter says, slurping another mouthful.\n\n\"The egregore connects points of Darkness, resonates with Pyramid constructs, but I cannot decipher their communications. Still\u2026 the Lunar Pyramid, the Europan Pyramid, and both Glykon and Leviathan all converse with the same distant point. What Rhulk spoke to, so does Calus. It is\u2026 gravely concerning.\"\n\n\"Wild,\" Drifter says with a whistle. He shakes his head and looks at her full bowl. \"You gonna eat that?\"\n\n\"I\u2026\" Eris wonders if he heard her correctly but knows repeating herself is an exercise in futility. \"\u2026What is this? Exactly?\"\n\n\"Pretty damn tasty is what it is. First time I got it right. Thought you'd appreciate someone cooking for you since you, uh\u2026 well, you're awful at it.\"\n\n\"Rat, what are you feeding me?\" She remembers his hunt earlier in the day, and her stomach turns. Eris stares at the Drifter, mouth agape in a half-heaved gag\u2014her thoughts racing over the things he's claimed to have consumed. \"You cooked me rotted Screebs.\"\n\n\"What?!\" Drifter chokes on the stew and coughs. \"I wouldn't feed you that crap, Moondust.\" He laughs. \"You never had crawdad stew?\" He holds his bowl to his lips. \"Or a close cousin to it\u2026\" he adds under his breath. \"Little swamp shrimps, you dig? It's a delicacy!\"\n\nEris reels her imagination in, takes a breath, and sips the broth without taking her eyes from the Drifter. The liquid fills her crumpled stomach with hearty warmth. She feels her stress melt away. The stew's flavor is far more pleasing than its smell. She smiles and drinks again.\n\n\"Thank you. It is\u2026 good.\"",
