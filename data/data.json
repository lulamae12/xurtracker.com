It had raged for years, just as it did before when Tohr had claimed the reigns and issued his challenge to Raiju's Maelstrom. \n\nClouds trundled at the storm's edge and forked bolts split through a central cumulonimbus supercell. Strikes of gnarled charge nipped scorch into the dirt with terrifying frequency as the sky rippled with lightning. Tohr's withered husk remained in meditative stillness, long dead, basking in the metronomic glow of each flashing termination. The armor around his corpse let slip a glint of light, pulsing like a guiding bannerette for thrill seekers. It had caught Tyv Lucine's eye many times.\n\nShe watched from the base, attempting to establish a safe route through the scattered fulmination. Salt-blasted dirt gave way underfoot, in places, while spindles of thatch-work glass weave held strong against her weight in others. She could feel static flow through the network of crystalline connections like conduits aching to reach out and touch the storm. Her Light shivered, welcoming the Arc surges that leapt up metal clasps on her boots, and she threw herself to another glossy foothold as a bolt dove to meet ground.\n\nThe Maelstrom calmed as she reached Tohr's body. A staff lay at his feet. The air was a screen of charged pressure around him, but Tyv knew how to find gaps. She knew how to bend away the lightning and loop Arc into itself. Lessons the Light had taught her. She slipped her hand through the barrier and lifted the plate from Tohr. She inhaled ozone and humidity and slid the Harness onto her shoulders.\n\nRoars thundered from overhead and bolts scattered across Tohr's hill. Tyv swept the staff off the ground and drove her Arc-Light into its form. The reigns were in hand; the challenge issued. She would bend the storm, and live as lightning made flesh.\n\n\n-Raiju's Legacy",

The Shadow partook with the stamina of a great Cabal primus, but the rogue ate even better, so well that even the generous Emperor, watching through his Shadow's eyes, was impressed.\n\nFinally, the last course was served: a flaky pastry the size of a human's fist. The rogue bit into it, and winced at the crunch, for the pastry was filled with metal and paint and the taste of vanilla.\n\nThe rogue ate it all.\n\nThen, wiping his lips, the rogue asked what was in the pastry. And the Shadow told him: \"Your Ghost.\"\n\nAnd before he could respond, the Shadow leapt up and, seizing more food and drink, forced it upon the rogue called Dredgen Hope in such generous quantities that the rogue could not endure his own gratitude.

One being threatened that above all, one who was pinned against the quiddity of death and exchanged one definition for another. This being the Shadows named Toland.\n\nSo the Shadows of Earth and the Awoken and the Hive entered the Deep Places and recovered an essence of the Deathsinger Ir Y\u00fbt. From her, they learned the Deathsong. By then manipulating the mind Quria, now bound to the Shadow of the Hive, they reversed the Deathsong, and sang Toland back to life.\n\nNow alive, Toland was once more weak against the powers of death, and he died in the mind and in the body. ^\n\nThus the Emperor's right was ensured.\n\n\n\n^A note to Underscribe Shipal: Please reverify your Hive sources.
