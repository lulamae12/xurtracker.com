The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Every creak and groan of his throne becomes excruciatingly pronounced. Spider reclines against one arm, rolling a dead Ghost's shell in one hand, scraping a clawed finger across its gray, lifeless eye. The arrival of a trusted associate pulls Spider from his thoughts. \n\n\"Avrok,\" Spider bellows, turning his attention to the armored Eliksni striding through the doorway, \"what did you find?\" \n\nAvrok approaches Spider's throne, wringing his hands together anxiously. \"Our thief, my lord.\" \n\nSpider leans forward with a groan of the cables suspending his throne. \"And what did you do to them?\" he asks in greedy anticipation. That, however, is where Avrok falters. \n\n\"I did not\u2026 catch them, my lord,\" Avrok humbly answers, his much smaller frame eclipsed in Spider's shadow. \"But I have a name.\" \n\n\"Out with it,\" Spider grouses, falling back against his throne with deflated interest. \n\n\"The Crow.\" \n\nSpider's blood turns to fire. His grip tightens on that dead Ghost so hard its shell cracks. Spider continues squeezing it until the glass eye completely pops. \n\nThen he takes a moment to compose himself. \n\n\"Our little bird, come home to the nest so soon? Tell me everything.\" \n\n\"He was able to infiltrate the storehouse,\" Avrok explains, \"and coerced a team of laborers to offload cargo promised to the empress onto a Skiff, which he then\u2026 stole. Along with a cache of your more\u2014ah\u2014personal belongings, among which was the quantum opal.\" \n\n Avrok shrinks lower, lower, lower. \"The supplies were delivered to Mithrax. In your name. As a gift.\" \n\n\"And the workers?\" Spider growls. \n\n\"They are gone?\" Avrok doesn't mean to make it sound like a question, and regrets taking the tone immediately. \n\n\"To where, exactly?\" \n\n\"They\u2026\" Avrok takes a small step back from Spider's throne. \"Left.\" He clenches his jaws. \"With the Crow.\" \n\nSpider slowly leans forward again. \n\n\"For Earth,\" Avrok concludes. \n\nThe Ether pipes begin to hum and rattle as a new batch begins production elsewhere in the complex. The noises rise in intensity, turning into the familiar hissing wail that joins with the uncomfortable sound of Spider. Laughing. \n\nThe Baron of the Shore throws his dead Ghost at Avrok who ducks away from it, covering his head with his hands. \n\n\"He's taking them to Mithrax,\" Spider says between fitful chuckles and wheezing coughs. \"He steals\u2014from me\u2014and gives it to the House of Light? Unbelievable.\" Though behind the laughter and coughs, there is a hint of appreciation in his tone. \"The kid's grown a spine.\" \n\n\"There is,\" Avrok starts, offering Spider a folded piece of paper, \"one more thing. He left this behind.\" Spider's seal is scribbled on one side. \"For you.\" \n\nAs Spider unfolds the note, Avrok creeps further away from the throne. Inside is nothing more than a crude drawing and a rude missive. \n\n \"That little sh\u2014 \"\n\nThe pipes are howling.",

If anything, it's good for a laugh. Don't let our favorite Praxic wear you down to a nub. If she gives you grief, you give her a swift kick from me. \u2014C.Y.\n\n[Attached transcript.]\n\n\n\nRECORD: 30.10.15.C.Y.Report\nIDENTITIES: Advisor Taurun [A.T.], Empress Caiatl [E.C.], The Spider [T.S.]\nFILE//HID_CLASSIFIED//AUDIO\n\n[A.T.] The connection is made. Let the imperial record show that, on this day, the great Empress Caiatl, ascendant of Calus, slayer of Umun'arath, convened via radio message with the Spider of the Tangled Shore, formerly of the House of\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Enough, Taurun. The scribes can add whatever flourishes they wish after the fact.\n\n[T.S.] Yes, let's not waste time. I know you have more important matters to attend to. Matters that I would be happy to help with\u2026 in my own small way.\n\n[E.C.] I would no sooner seek aid from you than a war beast would from a bog-tick. Do you know how many thieves I've had to excise from my ranks? They debased themselves. Crawling about our proving grounds. Refashioning battle-trash into weapons. All because you tempted them with a flash of Glimmer.\n\n[T.S.] Ha! Me? Tempt them? It's all I can do to keep them from flooding the market.\n\n[E.C.] This is not my first time dealing with war profiteers, insect. Though, if I squash you thoroughly enough, it may be my last.\n\n[T.S.] And here I thought I was doing you a charity, promoting Cabal entrepreneurship. I was told the empire was low on funds.\n\n[E.C.] Is that so?\n\n[T.S.] Your Majesty, I don't know what advice you've been getting from your imperial hangers-on, but\u2014\n\n[A.T.] How dare you\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Quiet.\n\n[T.S.] But things are different here in the Sol system. Smash and conquer\u2014like so many traditions of old Torobatl\u2014won't get you far. Ghaul found that out the hard way. The remnants of his Red Legion have learned to adapt.\n\n[T.S.] Let me know if you'd like to do the same. I'd even go against my own custom and consider a payment plan.\n\n[E.C.] How generous. But it seems I have no need. As you've revealed, I have untapped resources at my disposal.\n\n[T.S.] Whichever ones have survived your purge, yes. But weapons are not my most valuable wares, not by a long shot. If you're anything like your father, you'll be far more interested in the information I have to offer.\n\n[E.C.] Send your coordinates. We can discuss face-to-face. But tread lightly. I've yet to decide whether you're worth my mercy.\n\n[T.S.] Oh, I'm honored to host Her Imperial Highness on my humble Shore. It's no palatial estate, but we insects are just happy to have a place to call home.\n\n[End transmission.]",

One degree off spin-north.\" Uldren squinted downrange, as if peering into the sun. Jolyon frowned. The sun was behind them.\n\nThis was the first time he and Uldren had been to the range since their return from the Black Garden, and Jolyon was shocked by how hollowed-out his friend looked. Jolyon couldn't quite put his finger on what had changed, but there was definitely something new in Uldren's eyes. Something terribly familiar.\n\n\"Sending it.\" Jolyon pulled the trigger and missed by thirty meters. That's how far the calculations had shifted during his moment of hesitation. Jolyon grimaced.\n\n\"Nice shot,\" Uldren muttered, \"you always were the best.\"\n\nJolyon didn't even bother to hide his concern. It was clear that Uldren was also plagued by the nightmares. The nocturnal visions Jolyon dared not mention aloud. The grotesque beating heart, mangled by Vex technology, slimy with overripe pulp, thorny wires reaching outward. The wet mechanical thump of the dark beating heart, the thick beating heart\u2014\n\nJolyon snapped to. He had been drifting. He looked up to find the Awoken prince squinting down at him, as if trying to spot something in the distance. Something barely visible and receding further by the day.",

You're the only thing in the universe that would drive him to such lengths.\" He could feel the queen's cold glare boring a hole through the top of his head.\n\n\"Is that meant as an excuse, Jolyon?\" the queen seethed. \"Because it sounds remarkably petty. Childish, even. The Darkness is not something to be toyed with. Who knows what you might have awakened. My decree was for our protection. As my most trusted Crow, I would have thought you understood that.\"\n\n\"Yes, my queen. I understand.\"\n\nMara Sov slowly descended from her dais, looming over her childhood friend. Her subject. \"You say you understand, yet you directly disobeyed my command to avoid that place.\"\n\nShe bent forward at the waist, until her lips were nearly brushing his ear. Her voice dropped to a whisper. \"Is this treason?\" The word echoed silently through the empty throne room. Jolyon's blood froze.\n\n\"Please, my queen, try to understand. Uldren is your kin by birth. By blood. There is nothing you wouldn't do for each other.\" He paused, choosing his next words carefully. \"He is your brother, but he's mine as well. He's saved my life more times than I can count. And not just in battle. He's saved me from despair. From self-doubt. When Laviska died, when my world was crumbling, he saved me from myself.\"\n\nAs emotion welled up within him, Jolyon found the courage to raise his head and meet the queen's lofty gaze. \"Uldren is my brother too. I love him, and I would follow him anywhere. I would follow him into death, if he asked. Just as he would for you. And if you call that treason, so be it.\"",
