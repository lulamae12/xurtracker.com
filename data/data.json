The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

It's not because I don't know my answer, but because I want to feel like I still doubt it. I raise my head. Gaelin meets my eyes and looks up to the canopy.\n\nHe leans his shoulder into me and drops his voice to a whisper. \"My Clip's  a good one, but you need to realize Ghosts don't know anything.

Venus Forward Operating Base automated orbital defenses now online. \n\nHG01: No! Turn 'em off!\n\nVSYS: I cannot comply.\n\nHG01: Worthless piece of scrap!\n\nHG01: New plan! Captain Hennek, you still with us?\n\nCC03: Reading you loud and clear, Guardian! What's the plan? Those Cabal cruisers are right behind us!\n\nHG01: I'm sending you new coordinates! We'll make a few short jumps; try to lose them in the Re\u2014\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-236\n\nHG01: \u2014still work. Ah, see! Green blinking light means power.\n\nUNK1: This ship will never fly again, Human. What value is there in a flight recorder?\n\nHG01: You never write a journal before?\n\nUNK1: I have. But I fail to see the value.\n\nHG01: Well my options here are to talk to you\u2014and no offense, but you Reefborn are an acquired taste\u2014or talk to that one, and I don't speak Fallen.\n\nUNK2: [untranslated]\n\nHG01: You see what I mean?\n\nUNK1: So you would rather\u2026 talk to yourself.\n\nHG01: Now you got it. C'mon, help me disconnect the primary power coupli\u2014\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-238\n\nHG01: Been trying to figure out how to word this. Don't know if I'll ever make it back to Earth. The thought of not saying goodbye to you keeps eating away at me.\n\nHG01: I don't know if you're safe. Don't know if you made it out of the City. \n\nHG01: Comms are down, Cabal control the channels. Been trying to get the Awoken to help, but after the whoopin' Oryx gave them, they're reluctant to get between us and the Cabal.\n\nHG01: I miss you so damn much.\n\nHG01: If we see each other again, none of this will matter. I'll complain about Reef cuisine, you'll criticize all my tactical choices, and I'll fall asleep in your arms\u2026 None of this'll matter.\n\nHG01: But in case it does, I just\u2014I want you to know I love you. That, even out here beyond the light, I never forgot you.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-239\n\nHG01: We got the old Dead Orbit ship set up as a shelter. Atmospheric controls are still working, heat, radiation shielding seems good. The friendly Fallen out here are real helpful. I thought they were slaves of the Awoken at first, but it's\u2026 not like that at all.\n\nHG01: Captain Hennek finally succumbed to his injuries. I was with him when he went. Last thing he said to me was, \"I guess, right now, we're not all that different.\"\n\nHG01: [long silence]\n\nHG01: I wish you were here.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-240\n\n[ENTRY DELETED]\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-241\n\n[ENTRY DELETED]\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-242\n\nHG01: A Fallen named Kesk is helping me hardwire a linguistic modulator his people built into the flight recorder. Should translate their speech back to me in something I can understand, and then I can run it through the vocal processing heuristics onboard my jumpship to speak back.\n\nHG01: Faster than learning a language I don't have the mouth parts to speak.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-243\n\nHG01: Today was our anniversary. I hope we were looking at the same stars.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-244\n\nHG01: Traveler.\n\nUNK2: <<Great Machine.>>\n\nHG01: Huh. Okay.\n\nHG01: Family.\n\nUNK2: <<Ketch.>>\n\nHG01: Okay, that's where we're hitting a wall. Can we try some root words? We need to build the Fallen database.\n\nUNK2: <<Eliksni.>>\n\nHG01: Right, sorry. Eliksni.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-245\n\n[ENTRY DELETED]\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-246\n\nHG01: I had this dream\u2026 like a memory of a memory, you know? But I swear, I heard your laugh when I woke up.\n\nHG01: Being Lightless is hard, but it's\u2026 it's these little phantom pains that are the hardest.\n\nHG01: I feel like my whole life is a phantom limb. \n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-247\n\nHG01: Light.\n\nUNK2: Light.\n\nHG01: I'm not sure why I'm surprised by that.\n\nUNK2: <<We are all forged in the Light. It is what we lost.>>\n\nHG01: Yeah.\n\nUNK2: <<We are not all that different now, you and I.>>\n\nHG01: W-why do you say that?\n\nUNK2: <<When we live, it is in the shadow of the life we once had. When we die, it is the end of our story.>>\n\n[Long Silence]\n\nHG01: That\u2026 makes sense.\n\nUNK2: <<Many things do, when you take the time to stop and listen. To hear.>>\n\n[Long Silence]\n\nHG01: Dig.\n\nUNK2: <<Dig.>>\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-248\n\n[ENTRY DELETED]\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-250\n\nHG01: I'm heading back to Earth. The locals agreed to take care of the civilians.\n\nHG01: I don't know if I'll find you, but I can't sit here anymore.\n\nHG01: If I find you, you'll never hear this. But if I don't, and I live\u2026 Being here has opened my eyes to a lot of things and I just\u2014I can't fight like this anymore. Not without you. There's an enclave out past the Jovians; pacifists. You'll find me there.\n\nHG01: Kesk will have my Sidearm. I told him to give it to you if you come looking for me. Or\u2026 if he finds out you're\u2014gone\u2014to send it to the Vanguard.\n\nHG01: I won't need it anymore.\n\nHG01: All I need is you.\n\n// End Logs",
