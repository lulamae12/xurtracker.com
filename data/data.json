Squinted across the flat, dusty expanse of the High Plains. Ignored the Rifleman to address the other person on the channel, ex-Corsair Errol Mayz, who stood alone just over seven hundred meters from her position with his hands bound behind his back and a canister of ether balanced on his head. \n\n\"Errol, you son of a tech witch.\" \n\nShe could see his shoulders shift in an attempt at a casual shrug. His gruff voice tickled her ear through the comm. \"Sorry, Rin.\"\n\n\"You know the wager.\" The Rifleman didn't like to be ignored. \"Get on with it. If you think you can make the shot.\"\n\nMarin's eyes flicked to the hills of rubble dotting the High Plains, looking for the Rifleman's perch. Almost a sure thing the four-armed lunk on the far ridge was just another of the braggart's decoys, but no point risking Errol's life over a guess. \"I can make the shot. And I expect you to honor this wager when you're down a K of ether and I'm walking outta here with Mayz.\" \n\nRough alien laughter was the only reply. \n\nShe pulled three arrows out of her quiver and whispered, \"Pom, whatever happens, don't come out.\" Her Ghost answered her with a pulse of warmth in her left hand. \n\nTwo arrows she tucked into her belt. The third she nocked to her old friend, Trinity Ghoul. \n\nErrol's voice returned, so low she could almost feel hot breath on her ear. \n\n\"Hey, Rin.\" \n\n\"Don't talk. Don't breathe.\" \n\n\"Just don't miss. Okay?\" \n\n\"Good idea.\" \n\n\"You know what I mean.\" \n\nMarin pulled the Ghoul taut, lined up her shot with the canister perched atop Errol's scruffy blue head. \n\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"I know.\"",

I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy.

It had raged for years, just as it did before when Tohr had claimed the reigns and issued his challenge to Raiju's Maelstrom. \n\nClouds trundled at the storm's edge and forked bolts split through a central cumulonimbus supercell. Strikes of gnarled charge nipped scorch into the dirt with terrifying frequency as the sky rippled with lightning. Tohr's withered husk remained in meditative stillness, long dead, basking in the metronomic glow of each flashing termination. The armor around his corpse let slip a glint of light, pulsing like a guiding bannerette for thrill seekers. It had caught Tyv Lucine's eye many times.\n\nShe watched from the base, attempting to establish a safe route through the scattered fulmination. Salt-blasted dirt gave way underfoot, in places, while spindles of thatch-work glass weave held strong against her weight in others. She could feel static flow through the network of crystalline connections like conduits aching to reach out and touch the storm. Her Light shivered, welcoming the Arc surges that leapt up metal clasps on her boots, and she threw herself to another glossy foothold as a bolt dove to meet ground.\n\nThe Maelstrom calmed as she reached Tohr's body. A staff lay at his feet. The air was a screen of charged pressure around him, but Tyv knew how to find gaps. She knew how to bend away the lightning and loop Arc into itself. Lessons the Light had taught her. She slipped her hand through the barrier and lifted the plate from Tohr. She inhaled ozone and humidity and slid the Harness onto her shoulders.\n\nRoars thundered from overhead and bolts scattered across Tohr's hill. Tyv swept the staff off the ground and drove her Arc-Light into its form. The reigns were in hand; the challenge issued. She would bend the storm, and live as lightning made flesh.\n\n\n-Raiju's Legacy",

We are here to devise a plan.\n\nDO-AJ: We had one. It was rejected. The time for that is long past.\n\nIR: Your plan was to leave the Traveler.\n\nNM-EH: We are unprepared because we waste time debating.\n\nFWC-L2: We were prepared by every conflict that befell the City. This war has been written in the stars. Let it come.\n\nDO-AJ: Mobilize the fleet. We have guns enough. Surely, that option would please Lakshmi.\n\nFWC-L2: Yes.\n\nIR: The fire from your guns would have ricocheted off the Almighty's hull. How do you plan to wound the Pyramid?\n\nCZ: This was settled during the Red War. It has not changed. We will need the fleet in reserve should the situation turn dire.\n\nNM-EH: We will not flee the seat of our Golden Age. Enact war-time powers. A Monarch must be chosen.\n\nIR: [inaudible]\n\nNM-EH: How long has that omen been left buried on the Moon?

They are supported by Guardian operatives. They will work to contain the Darkness while we evacuate nearby assets and evaluate engagement strategies.\n\n[silence]\n\nCZ: In our haste to act, we were caught flat-footed. When we choose to strike again, we must be sure of its efficacy. We may only get one chance. You have all brought wisdom to this meeting. I have considered your council. Executor, I request the New Monarchy support us as they did so graciously when the Red Legion struck. Organize the movement of our people and coordinate with Suraya Hawthorne's contacts to secure them within the walls. Cousin Jalaal, I request Dead Orbit ships ferry the wayward home and provide transit security. In return, you will both be granted full access to the Vanguard's Luna site resources.\n\nNM-EH: A late invitation, but acceptable.\n\nDO-AJ: For the time being, we will protect caravans and aid in relocation.\n\nCZ: Good. Lakshmi, Project Stronghold will require additional printings. Ada-1 has agreed to lend her equipment and expertise to assist in this endeavor. Is this satisfactory?\n\nFWC-L2: Our forges are ready and eager. We request to assist the Bray in evaluating damage to the Warmind.\n\nCZ: Offer the help. Ana will accept it, I'm sure, so long as you defer to her oversight.\n\nFWC-L2: Her standing is tenuous. We believe it amicable to offer partnership, not support.\n\nCZ: You may suggest as much.\n\nIR: Do we have a consensus?\n\n[many voices pledge in agreement]\n\nIR: Adjourned.\n\n[nondescript shuffling and chatter]\n\n[door closing]\n\n[silence]\n\nIR: You offer too much. They want all the sway and none of the responsibility.\n\nCZ: Let them have both. Now is not the time to tangle ourselves in political conflicts.\n\nCZ: It won't be long before they realize Eris is the agent in question. She should be warned.\n\nIR: I'll reach out to her.",

We'll make a few short jumps; try to lose them in the Re\u2014\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-236\n\nHG01: \u2014still work. Ah, see! Green blinking light means power.\n\nUNK1: This ship will never fly again, Human. What value is there in a flight recorder?\n\nHG01: You never write a journal before?\n\nUNK1: I have. But I fail to see the value.\n\nHG01: Well my options here are to talk to you\u2014and no offense, but you Reefborn are an acquired taste\u2014or talk to that one, and I don't speak Fallen.\n\nUNK2: [untranslated]\n\nHG01: You see what I mean?\n\nUNK1: So you would rather\u2026 talk to yourself.\n\nHG01: Now you got it. C'mon, help me disconnect the primary power coupli\u2014\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-238\n\nHG01: Been trying to figure out how to word this. Don't know if I'll ever make it back to Earth. The thought of not saying goodbye to you keeps eating away at me.\n\nHG01: I don't know if you're safe. Don't know if you made it out of the City. \n\nHG01: Comms are down, Cabal control the channels. Been trying to get the Awoken to help, but after the whoopin' Oryx gave them, they're reluctant to get between us and the Cabal.\n\nHG01: I miss you so damn much.\n\nHG01: If we see each other again, none of this will matter. I'll complain about Reef cuisine, you'll criticize all my tactical choices, and I'll fall asleep in your arms\u2026 None of this'll matter.\n\nHG01: But in case it does, I just\u2014I want you to know I love you. That, even out here beyond the light, I never forgot you.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-239\n\nHG01: We got the old Dead Orbit ship set up as a shelter. Atmospheric controls are still working, heat, radiation shielding seems good. The friendly Fallen out here are real helpful. I thought they were slaves of the Awoken at first, but it's\u2026 not like that at all.\n\nHG01: Captain Hennek finally succumbed to his injuries. I was with him when he went. Last thing he said to me was, \"I guess, right now, we're not all that different.\"\n\nHG01: [long silence]\n\nHG01: I wish you were here.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-240\n\n[ENTRY DELETED]\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-241\n\n[ENTRY DELETED]\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-242\n\nHG01: A Fallen named Kesk is helping me hardwire a linguistic modulator his people built into the flight recorder. Should translate their speech back to me in something I can understand, and then I can run it through the vocal processing heuristics onboard my jumpship to speak back.\n\nHG01: Faster than learning a language I don't have the mouth parts to speak.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-243\n\nHG01: Today was our anniversary. I hope we were looking at the same stars.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-244\n\nHG01: Traveler.\n\nUNK2: <<Great Machine.>>\n\nHG01: Huh. Okay.\n\nHG01: Family.\n\nUNK2: <<Ketch.>>\n\nHG01: Okay, that's where we're hitting a wall. Can we try some root words? We need to build the Fallen database.\n\nUNK2: <<Eliksni.>>\n\nHG01: Right, sorry. Eliksni.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-245\n\n[ENTRY DELETED]\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-246\n\nHG01: I had this dream\u2026 like a memory of a memory, you know? But I swear, I heard your laugh when I woke up.\n\nHG01: Being Lightless is hard, but it's\u2026 it's these little phantom pains that are the hardest.\n\nHG01: I feel like my whole life is a phantom limb. \n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-247\n\nHG01: Light.\n\nUNK2: Light.\n\nHG01: I'm not sure why I'm surprised by that.\n\nUNK2: <<We are all forged in the Light. It is what we lost.>>\n\nHG01: Yeah.\n\nUNK2: <<We are not all that different now, you and I.>>\n\nHG01: W-why do you say that?\n\nUNK2: <<When we live, it is in the shadow of the life we once had. When we die, it is the end of our story.>>\n\n[Long Silence]\n\nHG01: That\u2026 makes sense.\n\nUNK2: <<Many things do, when you take the time to stop and listen. To hear.>>\n\n[Long Silence]\n\nHG01: Dig.\n\nUNK2: <<Dig.>>\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-248\n\n[ENTRY DELETED]\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-250\n\nHG01: I'm heading back to Earth. The locals agreed to take care of the civilians.\n\nHG01: I don't know if I'll find you, but I can't sit here anymore.\n\nHG01: If I find you, you'll never hear this. But if I don't, and I live\u2026 Being here has opened my eyes to a lot of things and I just\u2014I can't fight like this anymore. Not without you. There's an enclave out past the Jovians; pacifists. You'll find me there.\n\nHG01: Kesk will have my Sidearm. I told him to give it to you if you come looking for me. Or\u2026 if he finds out you're\u2014gone\u2014to send it to the Vanguard.\n\nHG01: I won't need it anymore.\n\nHG01: All I need is you.\n\n// End Logs",

But what if I told you that there is one who could cast a Hive-like shadow, with all its attendant majesty, but who is not herself Hive and therefore free of their tragic hunger?\"\n\nThe Emperor said, \"Show me this person, and I will lavish upon her all the gifts of the Shadows.\"\n\nSo the Shadow of Earth sought out Eris Morn, a Human with Acolyte eyes and the majesty of a Hive Queen in her calcified heart, and said: \"Eris Morn, True Queen of the Hive, I know one who can reteach you how to feel joy.\"\n\nEris Morn said, \"What are you saying? I am no Queen of the Hive. My sworn purpose is to defeat the Hive and the progenitors which spawned them.\"\n\nThe Shadow said, \"But what of your Acolyte eyes?\"\n\nAnd Eris Morn said, \"In my darkest hours I had no choice but to avail myself of my enemy's tools.\"\n\nThe Shadow said, \"So you are neither Hive Queen nor Hive God?\"\n\nEris Morn said, \"Neither am I.\"\n\nAnd the Shadow said, \"But could you be?\"\n\nAnd Eris Morn said, \"Yea, could I.\"^\n\n\n\n^ Note to Underscribe Shipal: While the broad arc and shape of time's arrow is known only to our revelatory majesty, and our humble duty merely to add texture to its form, I do enjoin upon you to make more effort than you are showing here. The characterization seems suspect and the dialogue is grossly wanting. Delete this footnote upon the rectification of this error. +\n\n+ Note from Scribe Savat: I see no reason for Scribe Shagac's harshness. I have closely studied the texts of the Sol System and of the Hive, and in my halls of learning Eris Morn's villainy is widely accepted. Therefore I deem this prediction's accuracy to be unimpeachable.",
