Squinted across the flat, dusty expanse of the High Plains. Ignored the Rifleman to address the other person on the channel, ex-Corsair Errol Mayz, who stood alone just over seven hundred meters from her position with his hands bound behind his back and a canister of ether balanced on his head. \n\n\"Errol, you son of a tech witch.\" \n\nShe could see his shoulders shift in an attempt at a casual shrug. His gruff voice tickled her ear through the comm. \"Sorry, Rin.\"\n\n\"You know the wager.\" The Rifleman didn't like to be ignored. \"Get on with it. If you think you can make the shot.\"\n\nMarin's eyes flicked to the hills of rubble dotting the High Plains, looking for the Rifleman's perch. Almost a sure thing the four-armed lunk on the far ridge was just another of the braggart's decoys, but no point risking Errol's life over a guess. \"I can make the shot. And I expect you to honor this wager when you're down a K of ether and I'm walking outta here with Mayz.\" \n\nRough alien laughter was the only reply. \n\nShe pulled three arrows out of her quiver and whispered, \"Pom, whatever happens, don't come out.\" Her Ghost answered her with a pulse of warmth in her left hand. \n\nTwo arrows she tucked into her belt. The third she nocked to her old friend, Trinity Ghoul. \n\nErrol's voice returned, so low she could almost feel hot breath on her ear. \n\n\"Hey, Rin.\" \n\n\"Don't talk. Don't breathe.\" \n\n\"Just don't miss. Okay?\" \n\n\"Good idea.\" \n\n\"You know what I mean.\" \n\nMarin pulled the Ghoul taut, lined up her shot with the canister perched atop Errol's scruffy blue head. \n\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"I know.\"",

Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here.

The stench of the Taken permeated her nostrils: ozone, gun lubricant, and the sickly sweet burn of soulfire.\n\nThe fusion rifle sounded again, closer this time. The shot was met with garbled hisses and return gunfire as the Taken rallied.\n\nAfter her abandonment, Sjari had tried to move as little as possible so as not to attract the attention of the Taken patrols that periodically swept the area. But the fighting moved closer, now a dozen meters from her hiding place. She quieted her fear and let her mind go lax, encouraging them to overlook her.\n\nShe had staved off the prying minds of the Taken Psions by lowering her heart rate and entering a deep meditative trance, sometimes for many hours at a time. But each time she re-emerged into her body, its demands became harder to ignore. She was desperate for food, for water, for anything.\n\nDespite all her training, she was nearing the end of her resolve. Until she heard a voice\u2014a soft, clear whisper in her ear: \"Have faith, my Techeuns. You are lost, but not forgotten. Help is on the way.\"\n\nIt seemed that Queen Mara's promise would finally come to pass. There was yet hope.",

I was wrong.\"\n\nBut Mara has been afforded no such opportunity, and on nights like tonight\u2014when she stares across the infinite void of space, alone\u2014she reminds herself that her brother's absence is what he desires. It's also what she deserves.\n\n\"My queen,\" a familiar voice murmurs from behind her. Mara turns to find Petra's figure cutting a harsh silhouette in her doorway. \n\n\"Where is he?\" Mara asks.\n\n\"The Leviathan.\" Shadows obscure Petra's face, making it impossible to read, and for a moment, Mara understands how others must often feel in her own presence. \"Eris tells me he sees himself there. He sees Uldren.\"\n\n\"I know,\" says Mara. Because of course she knows. She feels Crow's suffering as intensely as she feels the beating of his heart.\n\n\"You want to go to him,\" Petra states plainly. \"You shouldn't.\" Something steely has entered her voice; Mara recognizes it as a warning.\n\n\"I know that too.\" Mara turns back to the twinkling ocean of stars but focuses on the vast nothingness beyond it. \"Good night, Petra.\"\n\n\"Good night, my queen.\" Petra's retreating footsteps fade away, and Mara is alone again. \n\nNo, she thinks, not alone. She and her brother are together, even when they are apart. That is enough.\n\nIt must be.",

If anything, it's good for a laugh. Don't let our favorite Praxic wear you down to a nub. If she gives you grief, you give her a swift kick from me. \u2014C.Y.\n\n[Attached transcript.]\n\n\n\nRECORD: 30.10.15.C.Y.Report\nIDENTITIES: Advisor Taurun [A.T.], Empress Caiatl [E.C.], The Spider [T.S.]\nFILE//HID_CLASSIFIED//AUDIO\n\n[A.T.] The connection is made. Let the imperial record show that, on this day, the great Empress Caiatl, ascendant of Calus, slayer of Umun'arath, convened via radio message with the Spider of the Tangled Shore, formerly of the House of\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Enough, Taurun. The scribes can add whatever flourishes they wish after the fact.\n\n[T.S.] Yes, let's not waste time. I know you have more important matters to attend to. Matters that I would be happy to help with\u2026 in my own small way.\n\n[E.C.] I would no sooner seek aid from you than a war beast would from a bog-tick. Do you know how many thieves I've had to excise from my ranks? They debased themselves. Crawling about our proving grounds. Refashioning battle-trash into weapons. All because you tempted them with a flash of Glimmer.\n\n[T.S.] Ha! Me? Tempt them? It's all I can do to keep them from flooding the market.\n\n[E.C.] This is not my first time dealing with war profiteers, insect. Though, if I squash you thoroughly enough, it may be my last.\n\n[T.S.] And here I thought I was doing you a charity, promoting Cabal entrepreneurship. I was told the empire was low on funds.\n\n[E.C.] Is that so?\n\n[T.S.] Your Majesty, I don't know what advice you've been getting from your imperial hangers-on, but\u2014\n\n[A.T.] How dare you\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Quiet.\n\n[T.S.] But things are different here in the Sol system. Smash and conquer\u2014like so many traditions of old Torobatl\u2014won't get you far. Ghaul found that out the hard way. The remnants of his Red Legion have learned to adapt.\n\n[T.S.] Let me know if you'd like to do the same. I'd even go against my own custom and consider a payment plan.\n\n[E.C.] How generous. But it seems I have no need. As you've revealed, I have untapped resources at my disposal.\n\n[T.S.] Whichever ones have survived your purge, yes. But weapons are not my most valuable wares, not by a long shot. If you're anything like your father, you'll be far more interested in the information I have to offer.\n\n[E.C.] Send your coordinates. We can discuss face-to-face. But tread lightly. I've yet to decide whether you're worth my mercy.\n\n[T.S.] Oh, I'm honored to host Her Imperial Highness on my humble Shore. It's no palatial estate, but we insects are just happy to have a place to call home.\n\n[End transmission.]",

He was not the first Captain to strike here, but while others had come for killing or labor, his clutch of Vandals came for something else.\n\nA Lightbearer resided in the village\u2014a demon who had killed many of his friends. A demon who had shattered the Captain whose place Kethiks had taken. It was Kethiks's duty to seek revenge, to hunt this demon, and clear the death debt. Those were the words House Devils had sent with Kethiks. \n\nBut to Kethiks, this demon's life paid more than vengeance. Its life paid glory. The same glory Kethiks's father, Ykriis, claimed when he felled a Lightbearer in single combat, took its tiny machine and drank of its divine Ether. Soon that glory would be Kethiks's as well. Soon his position would be recognized for more than its circumstance.\n\nVandals crept on either side of Kethiks, maneuvering through tall grass with quiet anticipation. Where the grass died off to tilled soil and log walls, they paused, waiting for Kethiks's command. He would not launch flares to declare their strike. He would not give the Lightbearer time to plan.\n\nAs the rear-guard Dregs joined the rest of his raiding party, Kethiks ignited an Arc spear and raised it against the night. The signal: attack!\n\nThe raiders descended, expecting a paltry guard. They were soon met by stiff resistance. The Captain tore through to the heart of the village, hunting for the demon who commanded the defense. He spotted the demon in the midst of the fighting. Kethiks strode forward, seizing a defiant Human in his path with his lower arms and flung her through a burning wooden structure.\n\n\"DEMON!\" he shrieked in Eliksni, brandishing his Arc spear.\n\nBefore he could advance, a young Human defiantly stepped between him and the demon and brandished a blade. Kethiks assessed the \"warrior\" and clicked his mandibles in laughter, easily knocking the boy's curved blade aside. The Captain taunted the youth with half-hearted thrusts that threw the small Human off balance. When he was finished toying with his prey, Kethiks drove the spear point through him.\n\nKethiks looked up from the pinned youth to the demon and snarled. His eyes met the demon's crackling own. The Captain raised his spear to charge\u2014",
