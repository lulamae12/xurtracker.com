The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

He came to believe that each time his Ghost brought him back, he came back a new man. But he was a new man who carried with him the burden of all the lives before him. One after another after another, and each and every one of them weighed upon his shoulders in a way only Atlas could comprehend.\n\nBut he was a Titan.\n\nMuscle and might and metal\u2014a mountain of it, they said. There was no burden he could not bear. That's what they said. He nodded and waved away the adulations. He went to his quarters each night, in the half tower he had commissioned, and he laid in bed, his feet incapable of stillness as a thousand million insects scurried their way up and down the sinews of his muscles, instigating perpetual and maddening motions that all his muscle and might couldn't stop. An insurmountable restlessness that prevented what little respite he could find in his nightmare-fueled sleep.\n\nYet he was a champion. A leader. The bright shining example of all that was good and enduring.\n\nThere was a City to build. A species to protect. Extinction to prevent. Invaders to repel. Wars to fight. Lives to live. Deaths to die. What was it he said once to one of the newly risen? The Light shines brightest in those it consumes? Oh, how he felt consumed.\n\nHe stood up from his bed. Crossed to the window that framed the entity that had cursed him. Though it chose not to speak to him, he knew what it wanted. And the only way to end its curse was to give it what it wanted\u2014to destroy that which would see it destroyed.\n\nMaybe then he could sleep.",

The risks taken and the boundaries pushed to keep herself entertained and her Worm fed.\n\nBefore\u2026 \n\nOsiris stumbles as he walks through the Last City. Beneath his robes, something erupts in a frenzy of motion. He pauses to compose himself and then walks on, trailing careless spatters of black fluid.\n\nBefore\u2026\n\nOsiris watches the Crucible match unfold. He does not cheer for either opponent. When a Ghost appears to revive the defeated warrior, Osiris leans forward in careful study. When Saint places a hand on his forearm, Osiris holds impossibly still just to see what the other man will do.\n\nBefore\u2026\n\nOsiris sits by the campfire as Crow and the Guardian share a drink. Osiris watches them with rapt attention. Crow is laughing. He passes the bottle, and Osiris, hands numb, puzzles at it. His mouth hangs in a half-smile before he takes a long drink, slaking a bone-deep thirst. \n\nBefore\u2026\n\nOsiris takes a shaky step forward. The High Celebrant howls in the catacombs, and he hears his sister's voice buried in its roar. He feels his heart beating in his chest and is so enraptured by the sensation that he forgets to be frightened.\n\nBefore\u2026\n\nSavath\u00fbn, physical form a twisting instar, emerges from the shadows and crawls over the shattered pieces of the Ghost. She reaches toward the ruined man. \n\nBefore\u2026\n\nSavath\u00fbn squeezes through the calcified channels of ascendant energy and manifests within the dangling Ahamkara skull. \n\nThe man standing below the netting senses her appearance. His Light flares as he draws his weapon with impossible speed.\n\nShe has only a moment: She pushes her face down through the ropes, opens her mouth, and sings. \n\nThe man stops, then slowly holsters his weapon. He turns, crosses his arms, and forgets. \n\nShe melts awkwardly back into the skull as best she can, though a tangle of spindly elbows, licorice-black, still juts from its sockets. She turns her attention to her quarry across the gap and hums her song softly to mask herself. \n\nSoon, the man below begins to hum along with her.\n\nShe smiles.",

It was the appointment of a lifetime. \n\nDeep within the Halphas Electus, Ignovun oversaw his arena's preparation. There was the hanging of Caiatl's banners, the anointing of his ammunition, and the intonement of the Litany of the Chosen by an imperial mythkeeper. He was fitted for new armor that gleamed in the light. He was briefed on the protocols of the Rite, and the expectations of his victory. \n\nBut now, alone in the arena, doubt creeps into Ignovun's thoughts. Ghaul believed that the strength of the smallmen was their Light. He reasoned that the power of the Traveler, like any weapon, could be stripped from the enemy and used against them. Clearly, he was wrong. \n\nIgnovun believes differently. Their strength comes not from Light, but from death. The Guardians are already walking corpses, and yet they fight on. They have all died a thousand times, while Ignovun has yet to die even once. How can he defeat an opponent whom death cannot best? \n\nSuddenly, the treacherous ravings of Ixel, the Far-Reaching did not seem so absurd. If the Cabal are to triumph over the smallmen, they will have to succeed where Ghaul failed. They will have to bring mortality to the Vanguard. \n\nIgnovun knows that these musings will not save him.

She tooled the rifling in her barrels with the steady hand of an artisan. Her dyes, cobalt and ichor, shone bright as beetleshell.\n\nThe other, Gharhet, came from the distant plains. He traded for his wares and sold them dear, and thus he amassed great wealth. He embellished his goods with a rich lacquer the color of flame.\n\nWhen the Primus called for the strongest warriors to serve, the district knew the fighter Tlamus\u2014who had broken all challengers with her keen aim and powerful frame\u2014would represent them. Both Dhutus and Gharhet wished to outfit her with their finest pieces, as having a warrior of her status wear their colors would bring them great honor.\n\nSo Dhutus forged Tlamus a mighty war axe with an ice-blue handle and wide golden blade. Tlamus accepted the gift gladly.\n\nGharhet procured for her a Slug Rifle with bright orange plating, and Tlamus wore it proudly across her back.\n\nNext, Dhutus crafted a Shotgun, metal burnished deep as night with bright vents along the sides, and Tlamus brought it into battle.\n\nIn response, Gharhet bought a helm with thick plating and stout antlers the color of a sunset, and they were soon stained with the blood of Tlamus's foes.\n\nAnd Dhutus saw no end to this. Her shoulders ached from working the forge, and her hands were blistered by burns upon burns.\n\nSo Dhutus issued to Gharhet a challenge, and as he knew no one would raise the weapons of a coward, Gharhet accepted.\n\nThe next dawn found Dhutus on the battlefield waiting for her rival. On her shoulder was her finest weapon: a Rocket Launcher, its barrel a twisting column of seashell blue with gold trim, built as a gift for Tlamus but now wielded by its creator.\n\nFrom across the field, a figure strode forward to meet Dhutus\u2014but it was too wide to be Gharhet; too tall, too muscular. He had bought a champion to fight in his stead.\n\nAn orange sash was draped carelessly across her chest and dragged in the dust with each confident step. Studded orange leathers bound her massive arms and thighs. Strands of coral beads hung from her tusks.\n\nShe greeted Dhutus with a fist to her chest. \"I am Tlamus,\" she said, \"chosen of Gharhet.\"\n\nDhutus could not find her voice, and then Tlamus drew one of her beautiful, terrible weapons, and the rite was soon concluded.",

Certainly not as bad as whatever calamity they were prepping for, but bad enough to warrant the panic that coursed through his body. He hated these kinds of assignments.\n\n\"Hey, Morozova!\" Voronin called out to his ranking officer between heavy gasps. \"Any idea where all these are going?\"\n\nMorozova carefully placed her container on the ground, as if she was laying a child to bed. \"No clue. Word just came from on high to double-time it, though. Something about Titan has got everyone spooked.\"\n\nVoronin removed his helmet and wiped the sweat from his brow. Titan? What the hell happened out there? Comms had been spotty and the orders that did get through were light on details: Procure munitions. Transpo munitions to coordinates provided. Stockpile munitions. Repeat. No HMMWVs either. This was meant to be low profile, staying off the roads.\n\nWhere was all this firepower going, and what were we going to do with it when it got there? Voronin picked up his container and his pace.\n\nHe trudged just shy of a click behind Morozova for what felt like hours. These containers were cumbersome and it was the height of the driest summer he could remember.\n\nWhen they reached their destination, they received a cursory greeting from Bykov, who was busy compiling a list of all the deliverables. Two soldiers, whom Voronin didn't recognize, were placing the containers in the mouth of a shaft that protruded from the ground. One punched in a command and the shipment vanished below the surface with a hollow pneumatic \"whoomp.\"\n\n\"Where does that go?\" Voronin asked. Bykov's brows drew together and his expression hardened. He returned to his list.\n\n\"Ready for the next round?\" Morozova posed with more spunk than Voronin could muster in a year.\n\n\"If we must.\"\n\nThe sky grew gray, and clouds formed overhead as they left.

He could hardly believe he was still alive, bearing witness to the end of all things.\n\nThe storm encompassed the station, under siege from the elements. Civilians were being ushered toward the SMILE pods in droves as the lightning made its presence felt, igniting a nearby fuel supply. The explosion tore into the group, and as Voronin turned his head from the horror and the heat, he saw her. Roughly 250 meters away from the station. Morozova lay, singed and smoking, under rubble and ash.\n\nVoronin pulled up his sensorium, but the electromagnetic fields in the air reduced it to static. There was no way to know if she was still alive or salvageable. She had treated him with respect despite outranking him, and she had been there for him when his marriage went to hell\u2014\n\n\"We're all dead anyway,\" he thought and ran to her through the maelstrom of lightning and wind.\n\nAnd then he was there, pulling off his gloves and wiping ash and blood from her face, as the storm bore down upon him.\n\nAs he made peace with his mortality, just shy of 82 years old, the storm around them calmed. The lightning stopped. The wind died. At the station, the civilians' eyes were fixed on the sky, though Voronin was looking only at Morozova. She was breathing, barely. Her eyes opened and met his. A half-smile came across her lips, then froze as her eyes went past him and widened in awe.\n\nVoronin turned and found himself staring into the face of God.",

He tried to keep her leg clean while the wind caked them with dirt and debris. Lightning was drawing closer. The sterile scent of ozone had returned and he knew he didn't have much time. \"COME BACK!\" he shouted hopelessly to the God. He hoisted Morozova up, supporting her on his shoulder, and pushed back against the elements that were conspiring against him.\n\nIt was 250 meters to the evac station. Every step was a battle of attrition. At this point, the thought of coldsleep sounded comforting. He just had to make it to the SMILE pods. The storm had other plans. A nearby HMMWV was struck by a wayward bolt and the explosion threw them back. He felt Morozova torn from his side as he landed, and the sound of his skull hitting stone was louder than the thunder had been. As blackness crept into his vision, he saw the Traveler in the sky, moving away, abandoning him.\n\n\u2026and then he was being dragged from the wreckage and violence onto a gurney. \"\u2026Morozova?\" he struggled out. He was met with an oxygen mask. His eyes darted, in search of some sign that Morozova was alive. Voronin couldn't decipher anything out of the pandemonium around him. \"I'm sorry,\" he thought to himself while cursing the orb in the sky for deserting him.\n\nThe last thing he remembered before they placed him into coldsleep was an explosion in the sky so bright it blinded him.",

Certainly not as bad as whatever calamity they were prepping for, but bad enough to warrant the panic that coursed through his body. He hated these kinds of assignments.\n\n\"Hey, Morozova!\" Voronin called out to his ranking officer between heavy gasps. \"Any idea where all these are going?\"\n\nMorozova carefully placed her container on the ground, as if she was laying a child to bed. \"No clue. Word just came from on high to double-time it, though. Something about Titan has got everyone spooked.\"\n\nVoronin removed his helmet and wiped the sweat from his brow. Titan? What the hell happened out there? Comms had been spotty and the orders that did get through were light on details: Procure munitions. Transpo munitions to coordinates provided. Stockpile munitions. Repeat. No HMMWVs either. This was meant to be low profile, staying off the roads.\n\nWhere was all this firepower going, and what were we going to do with it when it got there? Voronin picked up his container and his pace.\n\nHe trudged just shy of a click behind Morozova for what felt like hours. These containers were cumbersome and it was the height of the driest summer he could remember.\n\nWhen they reached their destination, they received a cursory greeting from Bykov, who was busy compiling a list of all the deliverables. Two soldiers, whom Voronin didn't recognize, were placing the containers in the mouth of a shaft that protruded from the ground. One punched in a command and the shipment vanished below the surface with a hollow pneumatic \"whoomp.\"\n\n\"Where does that go?\" Voronin asked. Bykov's brows drew together and his expression hardened. He returned to his list.\n\n\"Ready for the next round?\" Morozova posed with more spunk than Voronin could muster in a year.\n\n\"If we must.\"\n\nThe sky grew gray, and clouds formed overhead as they left.

Civilians were being ushered toward the SMILE pods in droves as the lightning made its presence felt, igniting a nearby fuel supply. The explosion tore into the group, and as Voronin turned his head from the horror and the heat, he saw her. Roughly 250 meters away from the station. Morozova lay, singed and smoking, under rubble and ash.\n\nVoronin pulled up his sensorium, but the electromagnetic fields in the air reduced it to static. There was no way to know if she was still alive or salvageable. She had treated him with respect despite outranking him, and she had been there for him when his marriage went to hell\u2014\n\n\"We're all dead anyway,\" he thought and ran to her through the maelstrom of lightning and wind.\n\nAnd then he was there, pulling off his gloves and wiping ash and blood from her face, as the storm bore down upon him.\n\nAs he made peace with his mortality, just shy of 82 years old, the storm around them calmed. The lightning stopped. The wind died. At the station, the civilians' eyes were fixed on the sky, though Voronin was looking only at Morozova. She was breathing, barely. Her eyes opened and met his. A half-smile came across her lips, then froze as her eyes went past him and widened in awe.\n\nVoronin turned and found himself staring into the face of God.",

Certainly not as bad as whatever calamity they were prepping for, but bad enough to warrant the panic that coursed through his body. He hated these kinds of assignments.\n\n\"Hey, Morozova!\" Voronin called out to his ranking officer between heavy gasps. \"Any idea where all these are going?\"\nMorozova carefully placed her container on the ground, as if she was laying a child to bed. \"No clue. Word just came from on high to double-time it, though. Something about Titan has got everyone spooked.\"\n\nVoronin removed his helmet and wiped the sweat from his brow. Titan? What the hell happened out there? Comms had been spotty and the orders that did get through were light on details: Procure munitions. Transpo munitions to coordinates provided. Stockpile munitions. Repeat. No HMMWVs either. This was meant to be low profile, staying off the roads.\n\nWhere was all this firepower going, and what were we going to do with it when it got there? Voronin picked up his container and his pace.\n\nHe trudged just shy of a click behind Morozova for what felt like hours. These containers were cumbersome and it was the height of the driest summer he could remember.\n\nWhen they reached their destination, they received a cursory greeting from Bykov, who was busy compiling a list of all the deliverables. Two soldiers, whom Voronin didn't recognize, were placing the containers in the mouth of a shaft that protruded from the ground. One punched in a command and the shipment vanished below the surface with a hollow pneumatic \"whoomp.\"\n\n\"Where does that go?\" Voronin asked. Bykov's brows drew together and his expression hardened. He returned to his list.\n\n\"Ready for the next round?\" Morozova posed with more spunk than Voronin could muster in a year.\n\n\"If we must.\"\n\nThe sky grew gray, and clouds formed overhead as they left. Procure, repeat.",

He could hardly believe he was still alive, bearing witness to the end of all things.\n\nThe storm encompassed the station, under siege from the elements. Civilians were being ushered toward the SMILE pods in droves as the lightning made its presence felt, igniting a nearby fuel supply. The explosion tore into the group, and as Voronin turned his head from the horror and the heat, he saw her. Roughly 250 meters away from the station. Morozova lay, singed and smoking, under rubble and ash.\n\nVoronin pulled up his sensorium, but the electromagnetic fields in the air reduced it to static. There was no way to know if she was still alive or salvageable. She had treated him with respect despite outranking him, and she had been there for him when his marriage went to hell\u2014\n\n\"We're all dead anyway,\" he thought and ran to her through the maelstrom of lightning and wind.\n\nAnd then he was there, pulling off his gloves and wiping ash and blood from her face, as the storm bore down upon him.\n\nAs he made peace with his mortality, just shy of 82 years old, the storm around them calmed. The lightning stopped. The wind died. At the station, the civilians' eyes were fixed on the sky, though Voronin was looking only at Morozova. She was breathing, barely. Her eyes opened and met his. A half-smile came across her lips, then froze as her eyes went past him and widened in awe.\n\nVoronin turned and found himself staring into the face of God.",

His hand went to his chest without thinking, as if to make sure he was fully intact. His gaze shifted as a second bolt hit the ground near him, then another. He had never seen lightning so close before. Stunned, he stood his ground; while part of him knew he should be frightened for his life, he was more perplexed than afraid.\n\nThere was no rain. He looked toward the horizon, expecting clouds, expecting something, and only saw a shimmering curtain of blue lightning sifting toward him.\n\nHe raced for shelter in the surrounding field, abandoning his munitions container in the dust kicked up by his fevered stride. The strikes razed the ground, sparking wildfires and scorching stone. There was no logic to their timing, with bolts crashing so frequently, the sound of the thunder couldn't catch up.\n\nHe'd lost Morozova in the commotion. Already drained from hours spent hauling cargo, his mind recessed into primal instinct. RUN.\n\nSo he ran, doing his best to avoid the apocalypse that surrounded him. A call came through his earpiece as the ground quaked beneath him: \"\u2026 auxiliary evac station\u2026\" was all he could make out before a roar of thunder swallowed the transmission.\n\nHe knew he needed to head west toward the station. The wind picked up and blew him off his feet, and again he felt a moment of sheer amazement at the storm's sudden ferocity. He hit the ground hard and checked his sensorium. It was scrambled from all the sinuous electricity undulating through the air, but he could just barely make out his compass. West. He ran.",

He had heard the stories from throughout the system, but never did he think he would live to see it. Now it was as though it was seeing him.\n\nHe took a step forward as if it would bring him closer to the oblate spheroid in the sky above him. He stumbled. The ground had gotten so hot under him, the rubber on his boots had melted. A banal thought cut through his awe\u2014\"Now I look like a fool in front of the Traveler\"\u2014and he was ashamed.\n\n\nThe sound of cracking thunder still echoed in the distance. That was when he noticed he was in the eye of the storm. It was wailing all around him, but calm in his general circumference. Surely this was the Traveler's doing. The great savior. He grabbed Morozova, unsure of how long this would last, and brought her to her feet. She was badly injured, bleeding from a wound on her leg.\n\n\"Stay with me.\" He said to Morozova and the Traveler at once. Only one of them listened.
