The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Though he had fasted during his trip, Ahrrha knew that his solid frame still made him stand out. He feared it would reveal him as the imposter and infiltrator he was, even while dressed as a House Salvation deserter.\n\nDuring the approach to Earth, Ahrrha had been overawed. The Last City looked like a perfect ripple of Light from above, dropped from the impassive form of the Great Machine. Ahrrha wondered for the first time in his life if the Spider was wrong about the Guardians.\n\nBut his misgivings evaporated as soon as he emerged from the drop ship. Rather than living in a gleaming city of crystal, the Eliksni were packed into the bombed-out ruins of a former war zone. The area they'd been \"given\" appeared to be on the verge of collapse. \n\nAhrrha sneered inwardly. Did the Guardians really believe that the Eliksni could be pacified so cheaply? That they were content to live under the boots of the Vanguard, gnawing at scraps? Perhaps it was true for fools like Misraaks, his Awoken-raised hatchling, and cowards like the Empty Weaver. \n\nBut the Spider's acquiescence would not be so easily bought. In fact, Ahrrha thought, the Spider could probably own this settlement within a year. The generosity and goodwill of House Light would soon crumble to greed and hubris, as they all did. And once Spider's syndicate had a foothold, they would make the Vanguard pay. In Glimmer, weapons, Ether, and blood.",

She unloaded her fusion rifle into its face, trying to burrow rounds through its armored hide. She managed to blow off a chunk of its upper jaw before her rifle clicked empty. \n\nThe Corsair dove back behind her barricade, ammo spent. She looked around the Hall for the last time, admiring the elegant statues, her chest swelling with bittersweet pride. The faces of her people, Techeuns and Queens, presiding over the battle.

He pressed a hand to his eyes. A deep thrum filled his head, and he heard their claws on the walls all around him, their hissing laughter.\n\nHe turned toward the street, weapon raised. He felt his heart thudding in his chest and sweat beading on his back.\n\nAnother noise: someone pounding on glass behind him.\n\nHe spun and one of them was in his house, looking out at him through the window.

He merges into a crowd of karaoke enthusiasts and surveys the room.\n\nStanding just inside the tavern entrance is another cloaked figure.

But still, the shadows remember him, and he remembers their embrace.\n\nOsiris stirs from his reverie the moment his pursuer enters the alley. He can see her shadow cast across the wall, penned in by the scaffolding's negative space. It is an optical illusion of a prison, a trick of the eye. Aunor Mahal notices the configuration and appreciates the symbolism of walking into a spider's web just before Osiris lunges from the darkness, grabbing her by the collar of her robe to slam her up against the opposite wall.\n\nAunor grunts on impact, her gaze trailing down to Osiris's trembling hands holding fistfuls of fabric. While his stare is ferocious, his strength is lacking. She lets him hold her there against the wall, and the moment he realizes he's being pitied, Osiris releases her and takes a step back.\n\n\"Your mind is still sharp,\" Aunor opines.

Cabal architecture blends with rustic Human furnishings that would not look out of place in the Iron Temple. Tea is already steeping when Osiris joins Saladin at the table, the aroma of black Assam bringing back ancient sense memories.\n\n\"I assume your tastes haven't changed much,\" Saladin says, gesturing to the tea.\n\n\"Did Ikora ask you to check on me?\" Osiris asks, and realizes how defensive it sounds the moment it leaves his mouth. He masks his bitter regret by taking a sip of the too-hot tea.\n\n\"No. I wanted to check on an old friend.\" Saladin sits forward, cradling his own cup without lifting it from the table. \"But I see you survived a Lightless encounter with not one but two Hive gods. I'd say you're doing better than most.\"\n\nThe pride in Saladin's voice makes Osiris's stomach turn. Not out of uneasiness, but out of shame. And yet, Saladin's certainty isn't patronizing. It's not in his nature to be.\n\n\"You're content here?\" Osiris deflects. \"Among the Cabal?\"\n\nSaladin shrugs away his question. \"Contentment is a luxury neither of us can afford. I am here. That's what matters. My place is here now, and humanity is better for it.\" A moment of silence hangs over the two, and Saladin is the first to brave that space. \"How long has it been since you and I took tea together?\"\n\n\"I can't even remember,\" Osiris says. \"So long ago that it feels like a dream.\" Then, quieter: \"Jolder was there.\"\n\nSaladin says nothing, focusing instead on his rippling reflection in the teacup. \n\n\"I should not have mentioned her name,\" Osiris adds softly.\n\n\"No.\" Saladin's response is swift and firm. \"I don't want Jolder's memory to fade like so many others.

His partner is not dressed in armor, a sight few ever see. Instead, his broad shoulders are concealed by a loose poncho of magenta and lilac bearing embroidered bird patterns spun by Eliksni hands.\n\nSaint approaches and gently cups Osiris's face in his hands.

Work is still being done to repair the damage caused by Ghaul's invasion, and it is here in this place where rats scurry in the absence of citizens and where Osiris lies in wait. \n\nHe had been here once before, nestled in a crack at the foot of the Schnell building, cupping his hands to his face to hold back the dark tide of necrotic fluid pulsing from his\u2014\n\nNo. That was Savath\u00fbn. But still, the shadows remember him, and he remembers their embrace.\n\nOsiris stirs from his reverie the moment his pursuer enters the alley. He can see her shadow cast across the wall, penned in by the scaffolding's negative space. It is an optical illusion of a prison, a trick of the eye. Aunor Mahal notices the configuration and appreciates the symbolism of walking into a spider's web just before Osiris lunges from the darkness, grabbing her by the collar of her robe to slam her up against the opposite wall.\n\nAunor grunts on impact, her gaze trailing down to Osiris's trembling hands holding fistfuls of fabric. While his stare is ferocious, his strength is lacking. She lets him hold her there against the wall, and the moment he realizes he's being pitied, Osiris releases her and takes a step back.\n\n\"Your mind is still sharp,\" Aunor opines. It stings his pride, makes his jaw clench. \"What did you think was going to happen next? I'm not going to fight you.\" She looks him up and down. \"It wouldn't be sporting.\"\n\n\"I remember the day you were raised,\" Osiris says with hushed strength. \"Curled up beneath a ruined bus, screaming for help. Too terrified to listen to your Ghost, too frightened to hold the gun it had nudged under the wreck for you.\"\n\nAunor sucks in a breath through her teeth and smooths the front of her robe. \"I'm not here to hunt you,\" she clarifies. \"I'm here to keep you safe.\" \n\n\"From yourself\" is implied. To that, Osiris has no retort. He reconsiders his surroundings and his actions and shrinks away with regret.",

And yet\u2026\n\n\"I'm glad you could make it,\" is the warm greeting that Saladin Forge gives to Osiris as he steps into a study aboard the Ascendancy Flagship Eligos Lex V. Cabal architecture blends with rustic Human furnishings that would not look out of place in the Iron Temple. Tea is already steeping when Osiris joins Saladin at the table, the aroma of black Assam bringing back ancient sense memories.\n\n\"I assume your tastes haven't changed much,\" Saladin says, gesturing to the tea.\n\n\"Did Ikora ask you to check on me?\" Osiris asks, and realizes how defensive it sounds the moment it leaves his mouth. He masks his bitter regret by taking a sip of the too-hot tea.\n\n\"No. I wanted to check on an old friend.\" Saladin sits forward, cradling his own cup without lifting it from the table. \"But I see you survived a Lightless encounter with not one but two Hive gods. I'd say you're doing better than most.\"\n\nThe pride in Saladin's voice makes Osiris's stomach turn. Not out of uneasiness, but out of shame. And yet, Saladin's certainty isn't patronizing. It's not in his nature to be.\n\n\"You're content here?\" Osiris deflects. \"Among the Cabal?\"\n\nSaladin shrugs away his question. \"Contentment is a luxury neither of us can afford. I am here. That's what matters. My place is here now, and humanity is better for it.\" A moment of silence hangs over the two, and Saladin is the first to brave that space. \"How long has it been since you and I took tea together?\"\n\n\"I can't even remember,\" Osiris says. \"So long ago that it feels like a dream.\" Then, quieter: \"Jolder was there.\"\n\nSaladin says nothing, focusing instead on his rippling reflection in the teacup. \n\n\"I should not have mentioned her name,\" Osiris adds softly.\n\n\"No.\" Saladin's response is swift and firm. \"I don't want Jolder's memory to fade like so many others. It may hurt to remember, but that pain reminds us that we lived.\"",

An audio log plays on one of the tablets, with subtitles to translate the speaker's tongue of Ulurant:\n\n<<ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION HYDROGEN, HELIUM, METHANE.

LACK OF HABITATION IDEAL FOR CONCEALING CIVILIAN FLEET. NO SIGNS OF PRIOR HUMAN HABITATION. >>\n\nCursing, Osiris sweeps the tablet off the table along with the books and notes. A scream rises from his mouth, and as he turns in rage, he locks eyes with Saint. Fury burns away to a cool ember of shame the moment Saint steps from the kitchen doorway. His partner is not dressed in armor, a sight few ever see. Instead, his broad shoulders are concealed by a loose poncho of magenta and lilac bearing embroidered bird patterns spun by Eliksni hands.\n\nSaint approaches and gently cups Osiris's face in his hands. The gesture causes the tension to melt away, and Osiris rests a cheek against Saint's fingers.\n\n\"Why are you so angry?\" Saint asks, his voice gentle and reassuring. It isn't so much a question as it is an exercise.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" Osiris whispers into Saint's palm. \"That Ikora is right. That I\u2014That I'm\u2014\" It takes time for Osiris to make his fear real with words, but Saint gives it to him. \n\n\"\u2026That I'm broken.\"\n\nSaint pulls Osiris to his chest in a firm embrace, then presses a kiss to the top of his head. \"You are not a teacup,\" he whispers against the shorter man's scalp. \"People do not break, and you are not broken.\" Osiris rests his forehead against Saint's chest, at once feeling humbled and secure.\n\nThe embrace lingers for as long as Osiris needs it, and when he finally does lean back enough to look up into Saint's eyes, he asks, \"Then what am I?\"\n\nTo which Saint simply replies, \"You are enough.\"",

Work is still being done to repair the damage caused by Ghaul's invasion, and it is here in this place where rats scurry in the absence of citizens and where Osiris lies in wait. \n\nHe had been here once before, nestled in a crack at the foot of the Schnell building, cupping his hands to his face to hold back the dark tide of necrotic fluid pulsing from his\u2014\n\nNo. That was Savath\u00fbn. But still, the shadows remember him, and he remembers their embrace.\n\nOsiris stirs from his reverie the moment his pursuer enters the alley. He can see her shadow cast across the wall, penned in by the scaffolding's negative space. It is an optical illusion of a prison, a trick of the eye. Aunor Mahal notices the configuration and appreciates the symbolism of walking into a spider's web just before Osiris lunges from the darkness, grabbing her by the collar of her robe to slam her up against the opposite wall.\n\nAunor grunts on impact, her gaze trailing down to Osiris's trembling hands holding fistfuls of fabric. While his stare is ferocious, his strength is lacking. She lets him hold her there against the wall, and the moment he realizes he's being pitied, Osiris releases her and takes a step back.\n\n\"Your mind is still sharp,\" Aunor opines. It stings his pride, makes his jaw clench. \"What did you think was going to happen next? I'm not going to fight you.\" She looks him up and down. \"It wouldn't be sporting.\"\n\n\"I remember the day you were raised,\" Osiris says with hushed strength. \"Curled up beneath a ruined bus, screaming for help. Too terrified to listen to your Ghost, too frightened to hold the gun it had nudged under the wreck for you.\"\n\nAunor sucks in a breath through her teeth and smooths the front of her robe. \"I'm not here to hunt you,\" she clarifies. \"I'm here to keep you safe.\" \n\n\"From yourself\" is implied. To that, Osiris has no retort. He reconsiders his surroundings and his actions and shrinks away with regret.",

And yet\u2026\n\n\"I'm glad you could make it,\" is the warm greeting that Saladin Forge gives to Osiris as he steps into a study aboard the Ascendancy Flagship Eligos Lex V. Cabal architecture blends with rustic Human furnishings that would not look out of place in the Iron Temple. Tea is already steeping when Osiris joins Saladin at the table, the aroma of black Assam bringing back ancient sense memories.\n\n\"I assume your tastes haven't changed much,\" Saladin says, gesturing to the tea.\n\n\"Did Ikora ask you to check on me?\" Osiris asks, and realizes how defensive it sounds the moment it leaves his mouth. He masks his bitter regret by taking a sip of the too-hot tea.\n\n\"No. I wanted to check on an old friend.\" Saladin sits forward, cradling his own cup without lifting it from the table. \"But I see you survived a Lightless encounter with not one but two Hive gods. I'd say you're doing better than most.\"\n\nThe pride in Saladin's voice makes Osiris's stomach turn. Not out of uneasiness, but out of shame. And yet, Saladin's certainty isn't patronizing. It's not in his nature to be.\n\n\"You're content here?\" Osiris deflects. \"Among the Cabal?\"\n\nSaladin shrugs away his question. \"Contentment is a luxury neither of us can afford. I am here. That's what matters. My place is here now, and humanity is better for it.\" A moment of silence hangs over the two, and Saladin is the first to brave that space. \"How long has it been since you and I took tea together?\"\n\n\"I can't even remember,\" Osiris says. \"So long ago that it feels like a dream.\" Then, quieter: \"Jolder was there.\"\n\nSaladin says nothing, focusing instead on his rippling reflection in the teacup. \n\n\"I should not have mentioned her name,\" Osiris adds softly.\n\n\"No.\" Saladin's response is swift and firm. \"I don't want Jolder's memory to fade like so many others. It may hurt to remember, but that pain reminds us that we lived.\"",

They rest in a spot of sunlight spilling through a round window draped with linen curtains dyed sunset hues and framed by crawling ivy and wisteria.\n\nOsiris stoops over the table, half in the beam of afternoon light and half out. An audio log plays on one of the tablets, with subtitles to translate the speaker's tongue of Ulurant:\n\n<<ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION HYDROGEN, HELIUM, METHANE. SCANS SHOW NO ACTIVE STRUCTURES OR CIVILIZATIONS.>>\n\nOsiris clenches one hand into a trembling fist, then scrubs forward in the log.\n\n<<STARSHIP TRANSIT CORRIDORS NEAR PLANETARY BODY ARE NON-EXISTENT. LACK OF HABITATION IDEAL FOR CONCEALING CIVILIAN FLEET. NO SIGNS OF PRIOR HUMAN HABITATION. >>\n\nCursing, Osiris sweeps the tablet off the table along with the books and notes. A scream rises from his mouth, and as he turns in rage, he locks eyes with Saint. Fury burns away to a cool ember of shame the moment Saint steps from the kitchen doorway. His partner is not dressed in armor, a sight few ever see. Instead, his broad shoulders are concealed by a loose poncho of magenta and lilac bearing embroidered bird patterns spun by Eliksni hands.\n\nSaint approaches and gently cups Osiris's face in his hands. The gesture causes the tension to melt away, and Osiris rests a cheek against Saint's fingers.\n\n\"Why are you so angry?\" Saint asks, his voice gentle and reassuring. It isn't so much a question as it is an exercise.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" Osiris whispers into Saint's palm. \"That Ikora is right. That I\u2014That I'm\u2014\" It takes time for Osiris to make his fear real with words, but Saint gives it to him. \n\n\"\u2026That I'm broken.\"\n\nSaint pulls Osiris to his chest in a firm embrace, then presses a kiss to the top of his head. \"You are not a teacup,\" he he whispers against the shorter man's scalp.  \"People do not break, and you are not broken.\" Osiris rests his forehead against Saint's chest, at once feeling humbled and secure.\n\nThe embrace lingers for as long as Osiris needs it, and when he finally does lean back enough to look up into Saint's eyes, he asks, \"Then what am I?\"\n\nTo which Saint simply replies, \"You are enough.\"",
