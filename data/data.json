Anyway, we used to run resource grabs along a coast out east. We found the rifle in the ruins of a gamblin' hall. In a vault ten feet thick. Behind glass, like it was someone's somethin' special\u2014a real showpiece. Thought for sure we had a solid score. Funny bit was, the spot where we found it\u2026? It was named after the math. Or, that's what my partner said. My money says the opposite, but what I know about science and history is limited to what I can sell and the sum it'll fetch.\n\n\"So, we're out in that ruined hall with loot to spare and an old-time shooter that should trade for a small fortune. Then scavengers hit. Small crew, but mean. My partner took bolts. Dropped. I tried to cover him, but the pirates were on us. Last I saw, his Ghost got scraped by a line rifle. Nothing I could do. Only reason me and my girl made it out was she was off scoutin' our escape, and I\u2026 The Fallen were distracted by my partner.

You found an advanced Golden Age firearm with functional tech in a sealed chamber. You sold the weapon's tech to a gunsmith you won't name for a 'small fortune' in Glimmer. And your partner is nowhere to be found\u2014'dead by Fallen hands'\u2014so that 'fortune' is all yours. No need to split it.\"\n\n\"Sure.

The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Then another, followed immediately by a third. And finally, a full-blown Ketch de-cloaked above their position. There were but three of them to protect a hundred who had once been thrice that. Within minutes, it was only her.\n\nShe corralled the survivors into a cave that once upon a time wasn't a cave but more of an industrial drainage system. It was foul here; the radiation was practically palpable, and the survivors\u2014if they survived this day\u2014would likely find their lives shortened by years if not decades thanks to this poisoned solace.\n\nShe pushed them forward, deeper into the underground, as fast as they could manage. She carried two children, both eerily silent and unaffected. They, like their people, had endured more than she could imagine in their five-thousand kilometer exodus. They had given up their homes for the promise of something better. For the promise of hope and light and the strength of the pack. In their quest for better lives, they had lost almost everything.\n\nHer Ghost told her the bad news\u2014this cave system was a labyrinth extending dozens of kilometers with more dead-ends than not. The walls were deeply reinforced, and its scans could see but half a kilometer at best. It was going to be trial and error, and their pursuers were getting closer. Her Ghost didn't think they would make it. Not before\u2026\n\nOne of the children in her arms\u2014a little girl whose name was Violet\u2014looked her in the eye and told her, without a hint of doubt, that she knew her Guardian would let nothing happen to them. Not after how far they'd come. She smiled at Violet and told her, yes, everything was going to be okay.\n\nShe set the children down, told them to run ahead and join the others; she would be right behind them. Alone with her Ghost, she told it to lead them to safety. She would stay behind and buy them time. And by the Traveler's Light, it would be an eternity's worth.\n\nAnd so, reluctantly, her Ghost floated ahead to rejoin the exodus, but not before swearing it would come back to find her and bring her back, no matter how long it took.\n\nWith the light of her Ghost now out of sight and the soft wet steps of a hundred refugees out of ear-shot, she strapped on her helmet, tightened her gauntlets, and drew a line in the muck beneath her feet. When the chittering of Fallen Dregs finally began to echo through the tunnels, she reached for the Light and with it crafted a shield of Void energy.\n\nIf need be, she would hold this line until the end of time.",

I have completed my sweep through the Reef and am filing an incident report hence forth referred to as Inc-01, should it be referenced.\n\nShuffling is heard as the speaker adjusts. Papers sift and the microphone crackles slightly. \n\nRc-9: The basis of my visit to the Tangled Shore was to conduct routine Vanguard/Reef security sweeps, as agreed upon since the day of incursion. I was escorted most of the way to the Shore by Awoken gunships, and only landed once my long-range scanner picked up a sub-audio reading emanating from the underbelly of one of the larger asteroid landmasses. \n\nThe speaker clears their throat. \n\nRc-9: I called in the disturbance to a nearby Awoken vessel and was told to, and I quote, \"Mind my own business and be on my way,\" so naturally, I thanked them for their assistance, feigned departure, and landed to check it out. They didn't seem to notice the signal. At the signal's source, I discovered a small camp of what I initially thought were Scorn. Upon further observation, I found that these were not Scorn but Fallen afflicted with some kind of flesh deformity and mental degradation. Shot one dead and the others just looked at me. They didn't fight back. Fired a few cesium charges into the asteroid hole and watched 'em burn. Just sat there. I didn't hear it clearly, but they were chanting something. I don't know. Hard to hear over the fire. \n\nThe speaker laughs to themselves and emulates popping noises. \n\nRc-9: I heard more of them whispering a little deeper in, so I waited for the area to burn out and continued inside. I found one structure of apparent Hive architecture, though it did not appear to have been constructed in any traditional sense\u2026 but then again, I don't know what I should even expect from the Hive at this point. A single Fallen was inside, became violent when I approached and brandished a weapon. The weapon was not loaded, and I put them down. \n\nRc-9: My logs will show a few recovered pieces of equipment that I will list now. One presumably organic section of the Hive structure. It is perpetually wet, just\u2026 great job on that, and causes dizziness and blurred vision when held with ungloved hands. It also has the unnerving ability to project dysphoria or general unease. I was asked to collect a sample for study by my CO. I've done that. Put it in a lead box all the way in the back of the cargo hold. Yeah. Eternal tithings to Xivu Arath. Whatever. Um\u2026 as I was saying. \n\nA tin is heard being unlatched. \n\nRc-9: Also recovered: one tube-style Grenade Launcher. It has no foundry markings. Definitely not Fallen, and I don't think the Scorn even know how to make weapons. Do the Awoken make Grenade Launchers? Always struck me as a Human weapon. Beautiful weapon. The thing wants to be used. Maybe I'll get an opportunity to use it before I get back to the Tower. Lastly, I recovered a locational tracker from one of the Fallen. Following it back to someplace else in the Reef. Little remote. I'll call in my findings once I've finished there. \n\nRc-9: Beautiful weapon. \n\nThe recording cuts.",

And you know better than to return to me empty-handed. At least I thought you knew.\" Spider narrowed his eyes at his trembling Associate. \n\n\"I do, the Spider. I\u2026 I have information, but not about Darkness. I saw the Crow. Tailing the Golem and his crew.\" \n\n\"The Vanguard has him sniffing around Basilius, hm? So we do have something to trade with the empress after all. Not that it'll do her any good; my little bird  is devilishly hard to catch.\" Spider leaned forward. \"Now HE would've gotten me something useful from Europa. You might've learned from him.\" \n\n\"Yes, the Spider.\" Arrha nodded vigorously. The faint sounds of revelry drifted in from down the hall, where the other Associates were enjoying their week's earnings. \n\n\"Avrok already told me about Crow's new assignment as Vanguard agent. Apparently, he's placed quite the wager on one of the Cabal's silly Rites ,\" the Spider chuckled. \"Avrok should've dared him to bet his freedom. Could stand to win my whole trove, he's that valuable.\" \n\n\"Yes, the Spider,\" Arrha repeated. Out of corner of his eye, he could see his share of Ether waiting in the corner. \n\n\"Oh, take your wages and go. I ought to dock you for bringing me nothing, but I'm feeling generous this week.\" Spider's voice dropped into a growl. \"Remember that I am good to you, Arrha.\" \n\nArrha nodded as he scrambled to grab his Ether tanks and get out. Finally alone, the Spider sat back in his throne. \n\n\"It's Crow, really, that needs the reminder,\" he mused aloud. \"I wonder how I might give it to him?\"",

Every creak and groan of his throne becomes excruciatingly pronounced. Spider reclines against one arm, rolling a dead Ghost's shell in one hand, scraping a clawed finger across its gray, lifeless eye. The arrival of a trusted associate pulls Spider from his thoughts. \n\n\"Avrok,\" Spider bellows, turning his attention to the armored Eliksni striding through the doorway, \"what did you find?\" \n\nAvrok approaches Spider's throne, wringing his hands together anxiously. \"Our thief, my lord.\" \n\nSpider leans forward with a groan of the cables suspending his throne. \"And what did you do to them?\" he asks in greedy anticipation. That, however, is where Avrok falters. \n\n\"I did not\u2026 catch them, my lord,\" Avrok humbly answers, his much smaller frame eclipsed in Spider's shadow. \"But I have a name.\" \n\n\"Out with it,\" Spider grouses, falling back against his throne with deflated interest. \n\n\"The Crow.\" \n\nSpider's blood turns to fire. His grip tightens on that dead Ghost so hard its shell cracks. Spider continues squeezing it until the glass eye completely pops. \n\nThen he takes a moment to compose himself. \n\n\"Our little bird, come home to the nest so soon? Tell me everything.\" \n\n\"He was able to infiltrate the storehouse,\" Avrok explains, \"and coerced a team of laborers to offload cargo promised to the empress onto a Skiff, which he then\u2026 stole. Along with a cache of your more\u2014ah\u2014personal belongings, among which was the quantum opal.\" \n\n Avrok shrinks lower, lower, lower. \"The supplies were delivered to Mithrax. In your name. As a gift.\" \n\n\"And the workers?\" Spider growls. \n\n\"They are gone?\" Avrok doesn't mean to make it sound like a question, and regrets taking the tone immediately. \n\n\"To where, exactly?\" \n\n\"They\u2026\" Avrok takes a small step back from Spider's throne. \"Left.\" He clenches his jaws. \"With the Crow.\" \n\nSpider slowly leans forward again. \n\n\"For Earth,\" Avrok concludes. \n\nThe Ether pipes begin to hum and rattle as a new batch begins production elsewhere in the complex. The noises rise in intensity, turning into the familiar hissing wail that joins with the uncomfortable sound of Spider. Laughing. \n\nThe Baron of the Shore throws his dead Ghost at Avrok who ducks away from it, covering his head with his hands. \n\n\"He's taking them to Mithrax,\" Spider says between fitful chuckles and wheezing coughs. \"He steals\u2014from me\u2014and gives it to the House of Light? Unbelievable.\" Though behind the laughter and coughs, there is a hint of appreciation in his tone. \"The kid's grown a spine.\" \n\n\"There is,\" Avrok starts, offering Spider a folded piece of paper, \"one more thing. He left this behind.\" Spider's seal is scribbled on one side. \"For you.\" \n\nAs Spider unfolds the note, Avrok creeps further away from the throne. Inside is nothing more than a crude drawing and a rude missive. \n\n \"That little sh\u2014 \"\n\nThe pipes are howling.",

The vision immediately dissolved from Mithrax's mind. \n\n\"I am Misraaks, Kell of House Light,\" he said, putting a hand to his chest. \n\nThe Psion paused, then gestured to its chest and Mithrax's head. It held its hand open as if waiting for a response.\n\nMithrax nodded his assent, and into his mind was placed a scattering of orange cubes, a spiraling helix of inky fins, and the sensation of biting through an unripe fruit.\n\nThe vision faded. \"That is your true name?\" Mithrax asked. The Psion gave a short bow. \n\nMithrax smiled. \"I understand why Guardians simply call you 'the Psion,'\" he said. \n\nA swarm of smooth yellow planes fluttered through Mithrax's mind: laughter. \n\nMithrax stepped to the side, and the Psion moved past him. As it did so, there was a final vision: a wink of warm, cheerful brightness, fading but promising to return. \n\n\"To you, as well,\" Mithrax called, and the Psion vanished around the corner.",

Bioluminescent pollen swirled in her wake, barely visible in the glow of sundown. Cau'tor closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, reveling in the heady scent that marked the beginning of the wet season.\n\n\"Why did you bring me here?\" his daughter asked. Even as she spoke, Cau'tor pictured her from memory: a small child frolicking in brightly colored robes. He opened his eyes and saw a full-grown warrior in a towering battlesuit.\n\nHe gestured towards the plated broadsword stowed on her hip. \"The scribes said you fought ferociously in sparring this morning.\"\n\n\"My blade is insatiable,\" she replied, brandishing the weapon and playfully pointing it at her father. Her smile diminished slightly. \"You could have seen it yourself.\"\n\nCau'tor did his best to hide a wince. \"I will soon enough, Ta'nam.\"\n\nTa'nam sheathed the blade. Dried grass and petals crunched under Cau'tor's sabatons as he met his daughter and placed a hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"So what's this about\u2014a reminder of home on the eve of battle?\" Ta'nam asked.\n\nHer father scoffed. \"Do you really need reminding?\"\n\nTa'nam grimaced. \"I miss it every day.\"\n\n\"We all do,\" her father said with a heavy sigh. \"No, I wanted you to have one last chance to see it with your own eyes.\"\n\nTa'nam turned, her brow furrowed. \"Last chance?\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Cau'tor called out. A low rumble resonated through their bones and the world shifted. Distant mountains undulated and stretched towards the sky; flowers burst into clouds of wriggling bubbles. The world blurred as light and matter drained like viscous fluid towards a growing rift in the sky\u2014a shadow that grew until it consumed them.\n\nThey woke aboard the Barbatos Rex, still streaming through the stars. Their hands were clasped around the handle of a rusted antique blade. A Psion stood nearby as the last spectral tendrils of psionic energy connecting the three of them dissipated.\n\nCau'tor nodded at the Psion. \"Leave us.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Ta'nam said as soon as they were alone.\n\nCau'tor held the blade up. \"Four generations ago, this weapon earned our family's place in the empire. Its history makes it a strong locus for the mind-walk.\" He studied the knife carefully, testing its weight distribution. \"But history is a luxury of the victor.\"\n\nCau'tor took the weapon in both hands and broke it in half, grinding the brittle material in his gauntlets.\n\nTa'nam recoiled slightly. \"Father\u2026\"\n\n\"The world this came from is gone,\" Cau'tor continued. \"Home is no longer behind us. It is ahead in the distance, past a towering mountain, and over a great sea.\"\n\nTa'nam nodded. \"We are Cabal. We eat the mountains, and drink the seas.\"\n\nCau'tor leaned forward. \"But you cannot do this if your hunger is sated by indulgent reverie. So we will never walk these thoughts again.\"\n\nTa'nam stiffened. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"Sol is a graveyard for our people. But those warriors never watched our cities burn in soulfire. The memory of home should not be a comfort, my child, but the wound that drives your blood frenzy.\"\n\nTa'nam nodded, but the knot in her gut forced her to speak. \"Do you fear them, Father? The Sol warriors?\"\n\nCau'tor smiled proudly, and took his daughter's hand. \"I do not, my child. Because I fight with Ta'nam, and her blade is insatiable.\"",

She peeked out of the cavern's makeshift scrap-metal door and saw asteroids drifting over the Shore like sleeping goliaths in a lavender sea.\n\nScreeb chitters echoed through the air, grabbing the Centurion's attention. She snapped the door shut and readied her Slug Rifle, listening as the sound swelled. When silence finally returned, she crumpled against the wall and wearily dropped her weapon. The gun had been issued in her family's name and bathed in her brother's blood. Now it was a fading memento, lying in the dust beside a vigil of empty helmets.\n\nThe message played over again in her mind and she snarled. A crown. A gauntlet. A chalice. Nothing more than metal tortured with heat and molded into something else. Into someone else's vision. What had the empire molded her into? The low moan of some ancient cable resonated through her pressure suit, now comically oversized for her atrophied muscles.\n\nShe swung her gauntlet and crushed the comm device for good measure. Thresher engines roared in the distance, the sound of countless Legionaries answering the call. She hunkered down and fell into a deep slumber.",

                "ExtLore": "\"Hail, warrior of the empire,\" Empress Caiatl said as she approached the bedside of a wounded Red Legion Centurion. The soldier had been gazing solemnly out a porthole when the sound of her voice startled him. He turned suddenly, then winced in pain. Caiatl saw darkened synthetic fabric enveloping his torso and the entirety of his right arm, which itself looked frail and withered. She knew immediately that this Cabal would see no more battles.\n\n\"My empress!\" the warrior responded, clasping a fist to his chest with his unwrapped arm. Caiatl saluted in return.\n\nThe empress glanced at a monitor displaying the patient's data. \"Val'ast, born of Val'tui.\" She looked out the porthole; the brilliance of Sol beamed back at her. \"The empire has returned for you, Red Legionary, yet your heart seems heavy. Why do you languish?\"\n\nVal'ast looked away. \"I am sorry, Empress.\"\n\n\"Do not be sorry, my brother,\" Caiatl said.\n\nVal'ast sighed. \"For years, every day has been about survival. Just trying to stay in the fight. But now\u2026\" He trailed off and grasped the sheets of his bed, a cheap fabric but still softer than anything he'd felt in years.\n\n\"When you war for so long, peace can become its own struggle,\" Caiatl said.\n\nVal'ast let the fabric fall from his hand. \"I thought I was Acrius reborn, claiming another sun for our kind.\" He gazed out the porthole. \"But I failed.\"\n\nCaiatl smiled. \"I've always loved that tale.\" She pulled a stool over and sat. \"Did you know that there used to be more to it?\"\n\nVal'ast shook his head.\n\n\"It's an older version, not as popular in modern times, but I was lucky enough to learn it as a child,\" the empress continued. \"Before Acrius, three warriors sought to climb a great mountain and grasp the sun, but a terrible beast stood in their way.\n\n\"The first tried to outwit the beast and sneak through the shadows, but the beast smelled him still and ate the warrior in a single bite.\n\n\"The second tried to escape the beast, crafting a device to harness the wind and soar upward. But the fickle wind changed its mind and tossed her into the beast's maw.\n\n\"The third warrior challenged the beast head on, Severus in hand. She also fell to the beast's gnashing teeth, but not before her blade tasted blood.\"\n\nVal'ast frowned. \"They all failed?\"\n\nCaiatl considered the question. \"The first two, certainly. They thought battle could be avoided. But the third warrior died with pride and honor.\"\n\nVal'ast pondered for a moment. \"Even in defeat, she left her mark on her foe.\"\n\nCaiatl nodded. \"And the next time one of her kin faced it, the beast would be one blow closer to death.\"\n\n\"Did more come?\" Val'ast questioned.\n\n\"Of course!\" Caiatl exclaimed. \"They were Cabal, and the sun was theirs to claim. Over and over, their mightiest fell. But each time, another wound was struck, until the day came when a warrior landed the final blow. That warrior was Acrius.\"\n\nVal'ast frowned. \"Ever since I was a child, I saw Acrius as a hero\u2026\"\n\n\"He may have been,\" Caiatl replied as she clasped Val'ast's hand in hers. \"But so was the warrior who struck first.\"\n\nVal'ast's eyed glistened as he held her grip firmly. \"Thank you, Empress.\"\n\nCaiatl shook her head. \"My brother, it is the empire who thanks you.\"",

Time and again, he saved his own neck, only for the Legion to find a new assignment and cast him back into the fray; they knew he was weak, but with Legionaries falling in droves, there was no other choice.\n\n(A roar sweeps through the canyon as a smoking Thresher tumbles end over end into oblivion.)\n\nVatoc bore no guilt over his survival; to a Psion, survival was all you had. There was no honor to be gained, no advancement within ranks, no wealth to be accumulated. All the Legion left you with was your life, and Vatoc was going to make sure it lasted as long as possible.\n\nBut that was before Ghaul had been melted down to atoms and scattered across the stars. Before the failed gambit with the Warlock's time device. Before the Almighty, gleaming triumph of the Legion, was tossed like a pebble and swatted aside by an indifferent god.\n\nNow came Empress Caiatl, and with her, the promise of something Vatoc never imagined he would have: freedom. The full might of the empire had arrived in a cavalcade of frigates and carriers, filling the space between worlds with destructive power. For the first time in his life, Vatoc's choice was not merely just to survive, but a choice of what to live for.\n\n(A Colossus barks a rallying cry; a cacophony of Slug Rifles echoes in response.)\n\nThe battle swelled around him and his compatriots fell. He could see the route to safety. Dark crevasses tucked between tepui where he could run and hide.

This log focuses on a single file we were able to decrypt; for the full report on the contents of that data breach and further decryption attempts, please see log R11312.\n\nOstensibly, this file is a recipe for a dish to be served at some sort of official gathering in Caiatl's honor.

I believe this recipe is both old and born of the lower class, a case of poor laborers devising ingenious (yet challenging) ways to take unsold goods and turn them into something comforting and delicious. \n\nThat Caiatl chose this as a main dish for an official gathering speaks to the optics she wants to present; she may be trying to differentiate herself from the opulence of the Calus era and the utilitarianism of Ghaul's rule by relating to the common folk of the empire. \n\nNote that decryption was only mostly successful, and some data degradation occurred.

Bioluminescent pollen swirled in her wake, barely visible in the glow of sundown. Cau'tor closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, reveling in the heady scent that marked the beginning of the wet season.\n\n\"Why did you bring me here?\" his daughter asked. Even as she spoke, Cau'tor pictured her from memory: a small child frolicking in brightly colored robes. He opened his eyes and saw a full-grown warrior in a towering battlesuit.\n\nHe gestured towards the plated broadsword stowed on her hip. \"The scribes said you fought ferociously in sparring this morning.\"\n\n\"My blade is insatiable,\" she replied, brandishing the weapon and playfully pointing it at her father. Her smile diminished slightly. \"You could have seen it yourself.\"\n\nCau'tor did his best to hide a wince. \"I will soon enough, Ta'nam.\"\n\nTa'nam sheathed the blade. Dried grass and petals crunched under Cau'tor's sabatons as he met his daughter and placed a hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"So what's this about\u2014a reminder of home on the eve of battle?\" Ta'nam asked.\n\nHer father scoffed. \"Do you really need reminding?\"\n\nTa'nam grimaced. \"I miss it every day.\"\n\n\"We all do,\" her father said with a heavy sigh. \"No, I wanted you to have one last chance to see it with your own eyes.\"\n\nTa'nam turned, her brow furrowed. \"Last chance?\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Cau'tor called out. A low rumble resonated through their bones and the world shifted. Distant mountains undulated and stretched towards the sky; flowers burst into clouds of wriggling bubbles. The world blurred as light and matter drained like viscous fluid towards a growing rift in the sky\u2014a shadow that grew until it consumed them.\n\nThey woke aboard the Barbatos Rex, still streaming through the stars. Their hands were clasped around the handle of a rusted antique blade. A Psion stood nearby as the last spectral tendrils of psionic energy connecting the three of them dissipated.\n\nCau'tor nodded at the Psion. \"Leave us.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Ta'nam said as soon as they were alone.\n\nCau'tor held the blade up. \"Four generations ago, this weapon earned our family's place in the empire. Its history makes it a strong locus for the mind-walk.\" He studied the knife carefully, testing its weight distribution. \"But history is a luxury of the victor.\"\n\nCau'tor took the weapon in both hands and broke it in half, grinding the brittle material in his gauntlets.\n\nTa'nam recoiled slightly. \"Father\u2026\"\n\n\"The world this came from is gone,\" Cau'tor continued. \"Home is no longer behind us. It is ahead in the distance, past a towering mountain, and over a great sea.\"\n\nTa'nam nodded. \"We are Cabal. We eat the mountains, and drink the seas.\"\n\nCau'tor leaned forward. \"But you cannot do this if your hunger is sated by indulgent reverie. So we will never walk these thoughts again.\"\n\nTa'nam stiffened. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"Sol is a graveyard for our people. But those warriors never watched our cities burn in soulfire. The memory of home should not be a comfort, my child, but the wound that drives your blood frenzy.\"\n\nTa'nam nodded, but the knot in her gut forced her to speak. \"Do you fear them, Father? The Sol warriors?\"\n\nCau'tor smiled proudly, and took his daughter's hand. \"I do not, my child. Because I fight with Ta'nam, and her blade is insatiable.\"",

                "ExtLore": "\"Hail, warrior of the empire,\" Empress Caiatl said as she approached the bedside of a wounded Red Legion Centurion. The soldier had been gazing solemnly out a porthole when the sound of her voice startled him. He turned suddenly, then winced in pain. Caiatl saw darkened synthetic fabric enveloping his torso and the entirety of his right arm, which itself looked frail and withered. She knew immediately that this Cabal would see no more battles.\n\n\"My empress!\" the warrior responded, clasping a fist to his chest with his unwrapped arm. Caiatl saluted in return.\n\nThe empress glanced at a monitor displaying the patient's data. \"Val'ast, born of Val'tui.\" She looked out the porthole; the brilliance of Sol beamed back at her. \"The empire has returned for you, Red Legionary, yet your heart seems heavy. Why do you languish?\"\n\nVal'ast looked away. \"I am sorry, Empress.\"\n\n\"Do not be sorry, my brother,\" Caiatl said.\n\nVal'ast sighed. \"For years, every day has been about survival. Just trying to stay in the fight. But now\u2026\" He trailed off and grasped the sheets of his bed, a cheap fabric but still softer than anything he'd felt in years.\n\n\"When you war for so long, peace can become its own struggle,\" Caiatl said.\n\nVal'ast let the fabric fall from his hand. \"I thought I was Acrius reborn, claiming another sun for our kind.\" He gazed out the porthole. \"But I failed.\"\n\nCaiatl smiled. \"I've always loved that tale.\" She pulled a stool over and sat. \"Did you know that there used to be more to it?\"\n\nVal'ast shook his head.\n\n\"It's an older version, not as popular in modern times, but I was lucky enough to learn it as a child,\" the empress continued. \"Before Acrius, three warriors sought to climb a great mountain and grasp the sun, but a terrible beast stood in their way.\n\n\"The first tried to outwit the beast and sneak through the shadows, but the beast smelled him still and ate the warrior in a single bite.\n\n\"The second tried to escape the beast, crafting a device to harness the wind and soar upward. But the fickle wind changed its mind and tossed her into the beast's maw.\n\n\"The third warrior challenged the beast head on, Severus in hand. She also fell to the beast's gnashing teeth, but not before her blade tasted blood.\"\n\nVal'ast frowned. \"They all failed?\"\n\nCaiatl considered the question. \"The first two, certainly. They thought battle could be avoided. But the third warrior died with pride and honor.\"\n\nVal'ast pondered for a moment. \"Even in defeat, she left her mark on her foe.\"\n\nCaiatl nodded. \"And the next time one of her kin faced it, the beast would be one blow closer to death.\"\n\n\"Did more come?\" Val'ast questioned.\n\n\"Of course!\" Caiatl exclaimed. \"They were Cabal, and the sun was theirs to claim. Over and over, their mightiest fell. But each time, another wound was struck, until the day came when a warrior landed the final blow. That warrior was Acrius.\"\n\nVal'ast frowned. \"Ever since I was a child, I saw Acrius as a hero\u2026\"\n\n\"He may have been,\" Caiatl replied as she clasped Val'ast's hand in hers. \"But so was the warrior who struck first.\"\n\nVal'ast's eyed glistened as he held her grip firmly. \"Thank you, Empress.\"\n\nCaiatl shook her head. \"My brother, it is the empire who thanks you.\"",

Time and again, he saved his own neck, only for the Legion to find a new assignment and cast him back into the fray; they knew he was weak, but with Legionaries falling in droves, there was no other choice.\n\n(A roar sweeps through the canyon as a smoking Thresher tumbles end over end into oblivion.)\n\nVatoc bore no guilt over his survival; to a Psion, survival was all you had. There was no honor to be gained, no advancement within ranks, no wealth to be accumulated. All the Legion left you with was your life, and Vatoc was going to make sure it lasted as long as possible.\n\nBut that was before Ghaul had been melted down to atoms and scattered across the stars. Before the failed gambit with the Warlock's time device. Before the Almighty, gleaming triumph of the Legion, was tossed like a pebble and swatted aside by an indifferent god.\n\nNow came Empress Caiatl, and with her, the promise of something Vatoc never imagined he would have: freedom. The full might of the empire had arrived in a cavalcade of frigates and carriers, filling the space between worlds with destructive power. For the first time in his life, Vatoc's choice was not merely just to survive, but a choice of what to live for.\n\n(A Colossus barks a rallying cry; a cacophony of Slug Rifles echoes in response.)\n\nThe battle swelled around him and his compatriots fell. He could see the route to safety. Dark crevasses tucked between tepui where he could run and hide. Where he knew he could survive.\n\n(Vatoc reloads his rifle and sings an oath to his empress.)\n\nHe had been a coward before, but no longer.",

This log focuses on a single file we were able to decrypt; for the full report on the contents of that data breach and further decryption attempts, please see log R11312.\n\nOstensibly, this file is a recipe for a dish to be served at some sort of official gathering in Caiatl's honor. The ingredients mentioned here have been seen in a variety of ancient Cabal texts, and analysis of the empire's economic history implies that they are considered cheap and undesirable. I believe this recipe is both old and born of the lower class, a case of poor laborers devising ingenious (yet challenging) ways to take unsold goods and turn them into something comforting and delicious. \n\nThat Caiatl chose this as a main dish for an official gathering speaks to the optics she wants to present; she may be trying to differentiate herself from the opulence of the Calus era and the utilitarianism of Ghaul's rule by relating to the common folk of the empire. \n\nNote that decryption was only mostly successful, and some data degradation occurred. Cryptarch's comments are in-line for ease of understanding.

Bioluminescent pollen swirled in her wake, barely visible in the glow of sundown. Cau'tor closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, reveling in the heady scent that marked the beginning of the wet season.\n\n\"Why did you bring me here?\" his daughter asked. Even as she spoke, Cau'tor pictured her from memory: a small child frolicking in brightly colored robes. He opened his eyes and saw a full-grown warrior in a towering battlesuit.\n\nHe gestured towards the plated broadsword stowed on her hip. \"The scribes said you fought ferociously in sparring this morning.\"\n\n\"My blade is insatiable,\" she replied, brandishing the weapon and playfully pointing it at her father. Her smile diminished slightly. \"You could have seen it yourself.\"\n\nCau'tor did his best to hide a wince. \"I will soon enough, Ta'nam.\"\n\nTa'nam sheathed the blade. Dried grass and petals crunched under Cau'tor's sabatons as he met his daughter and placed a hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"So what's this about\u2014a reminder of home on the eve of battle?\" Ta'nam asked.\n\nHer father scoffed. \"Do you really need reminding?\"\n\nTa'nam grimaced. \"I miss it every day.\"\n\n\"We all do,\" her father said with a heavy sigh. \"No, I wanted you to have one last chance to see it with your own eyes.\"\n\nTa'nam turned, her brow furrowed. \"Last chance?\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Cau'tor called out. A low rumble resonated through their bones and the world shifted. Distant mountains undulated and stretched towards the sky; flowers burst into clouds of wriggling bubbles. The world blurred as light and matter drained like viscous fluid towards a growing rift in the sky\u2014a shadow that grew until it consumed them.\n\nThey woke aboard the Barbatos Rex, still streaming through the stars. Their hands were clasped around the handle of a rusted antique blade. A Psion stood nearby as the last spectral tendrils of psionic energy connecting the three of them dissipated.\n\nCau'tor nodded at the Psion. \"Leave us.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Ta'nam said as soon as they were alone.\n\nCau'tor held the blade up. \"Four generations ago, this weapon earned our family's place in the empire. Its history makes it a strong locus for the mind-walk.\" He studied the knife carefully, testing its weight distribution. \"But history is a luxury of the victor.\"\n\nCau'tor took the weapon in both hands and broke it in half, grinding the brittle material in his gauntlets.\n\nTa'nam recoiled slightly. \"Father\u2026\"\n\n\"The world this came from is gone,\" Cau'tor continued. \"Home is no longer behind us. It is ahead in the distance, past a towering mountain, and over a great sea.\"\n\nTa'nam nodded. \"We are Cabal. We eat the mountains, and drink the seas.\"\n\nCau'tor leaned forward. \"But you cannot do this if your hunger is sated by indulgent reverie. So we will never walk these thoughts again.\"\n\nTa'nam stiffened. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"Sol is a graveyard for our people. But those warriors never watched our cities burn in soulfire. The memory of home should not be a comfort, my child, but the wound that drives your blood frenzy.\"\n\nTa'nam nodded, but the knot in her gut forced her to speak. \"Do you fear them, Father? The Sol warriors?\"\n\nCau'tor smiled proudly, and took his daughter's hand. \"I do not, my child. Because I fight with Ta'nam, and her blade is insatiable.\"",

But now\u2026\" He trailed off and grasped the sheets of his bed, a cheap fabric but still softer than anything he'd felt in years.\n\n\"When you war for so long, peace can become its own struggle,\" Caiatl said.\n\nVal'ast let the fabric fall from his hand. \"I thought I was Acrius reborn, claiming another sun for our kind.\" He gazed out the porthole. \"But I failed.\"\n\nCaiatl smiled. \"I've always loved that tale.\" She pulled a stool over and sat. \"Did you know that there used to be more to it?\"\n\nVal'ast shook his head.\n\n\"It's an older version, not as popular in modern times, but I was lucky enough to learn it as a child,\" the empress continued. \"Before Acrius, three warriors sought to climb a great mountain and grasp the sun, but a terrible beast stood in their way.\n\n\"The first tried to outwit the beast and sneak through the shadows, but the beast smelled him still and ate the warrior in a single bite.\n\n\"The second tried to escape the beast, crafting a device to harness the wind and soar upward. But the fickle wind changed its mind and tossed her into the beast's maw.\n\n\"The third warrior challenged the beast head on, Severus in hand. She also fell to the beast's gnashing teeth, but not before her blade tasted blood.\"\n\nVal'ast frowned. \"They all failed?\"\n\nCaiatl considered the question. \"The first two, certainly. They thought battle could be avoided. But the third warrior died with pride and honor.\"\n\nVal'ast pondered for a moment. \"Even in defeat, she left her mark on her foe.\"\n\nCaiatl nodded. \"And the next time one of her kin faced it, the beast would be one blow closer to death.\"\n\n\"Did more come?\" Val'ast questioned.\n\n\"Of course!\" Caiatl exclaimed. \"They were Cabal, and the sun was theirs to claim. Over and over, their mightiest fell. But each time, another wound was struck, until the day came when a warrior landed the final blow. That warrior was Acrius.\"\n\nVal'ast frowned. \"Ever since I was a child, I saw Acrius as a hero\u2026\"\n\n\"He may have been,\" Caiatl replied as she clasped Val'ast's hand in hers. \"But so was the warrior who struck first.\"\n\nVal'ast's eyed glistened as he held her grip firmly. \"Thank you, Empress.\"\n\nCaiatl shook her head. \"My brother, it is the empire who thanks you.\"",

As he braced behind a Vex tower and clutched his empty rifle, he recalled his legacy of hasty retreats.\n\nHe had run from Wire Rifle enfilades and soulfire barrages on the detritus flotillas of the Reef.\n\nHe had fled the relentless advance of the chronomatons, nearly boiling in his suit amidst mercurial deserts.\n\nMost of all, he had run from the Light-infested husks, the undying Guardians of Sol. Time and again, he saved his own neck, only for the Legion to find a new assignment and cast him back into the fray; they knew he was weak, but with Legionaries falling in droves, there was no other choice.\n\n(A roar sweeps through the canyon as a smoking Thresher tumbles end over end into oblivion.)\n\nVatoc bore no guilt over his survival; to a Psion, survival was all you had. There was no honor to be gained, no advancement within ranks, no wealth to be accumulated. All the Legion left you with was your life, and Vatoc was going to make sure it lasted as long as possible.\n\nBut that was before Ghaul had been melted down to atoms and scattered across the stars. Before the failed gambit with the Warlock's time device. Before the Almighty, gleaming triumph of the Legion, was tossed like a pebble and swatted aside by an indifferent god.\n\nNow came Empress Caiatl, and with her, the promise of something Vatoc never imagined he would have: freedom. The full might of the empire had arrived in a cavalcade of frigates and carriers, filling the space between worlds with destructive power. For the first time in his life, Vatoc's choice was not merely just to survive, but a choice of what to live for.\n\n(A Colossus barks a rallying cry; a cacophony of Slug Rifles echoes in response.)\n\nThe battle swelled around him and his compatriots fell. He could see the route to safety. Dark crevasses tucked between tepui where he could run and hide. Where he knew he could survive.\n\n(Vatoc reloads his rifle and sings an oath to his empress.)\n\nHe had been a coward before, but no longer.",

This log focuses on a single file we were able to decrypt; for the full report on the contents of that data breach and further decryption attempts, please see log R11312.\n\nOstensibly, this file is a recipe for a dish to be served at some sort of official gathering in Caiatl's honor. The ingredients mentioned here have been seen in a variety of ancient Cabal texts, and analysis of the empire's economic history implies that they are considered cheap and undesirable. I believe this recipe is both old and born of the lower class, a case of poor laborers devising ingenious (yet challenging) ways to take unsold goods and turn them into something comforting and delicious. \n\nThat Caiatl chose this as a main dish for an official gathering speaks to the optics she wants to present; she may be trying to differentiate herself from the opulence of the Calus era and the utilitarianism of Ghaul's rule by relating to the common folk of the empire. \n\nNote that decryption was only mostly successful, and some data degradation occurred. Cryptarch's comments are in-line for ease of understanding. Some translations remain ambiguous, but I've provided my best hypotheses.\n\n// FILE START //\u2014 [CBX PARSER ERROR]\n\n\u2014 [CBX PARSER ERROR] \n\n\u2014 [CBX PARSER ERROR] until the solvent mixture has blended together.\n\n\u2014 Pulverize atlotl tendons until just pliable and surfaces begin to crack, then dredge in solvent mixture and let soak for [36\u201384 hours; the cycle referenced here is unknown, estimates are conservative guess].\n\n\u2014 To make the [black cube], crush citrus mixture, then drain through a sieve.
