The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

It's not because I don't know my answer, but because I want to feel like I still doubt it. I raise my head.

It had raged for years, just as it did before when Tohr had claimed the reigns and issued his challenge to Raiju's Maelstrom. \n\nClouds trundled at the storm's edge and forked bolts split through a central cumulonimbus supercell. Strikes of gnarled charge nipped scorch into the dirt with terrifying frequency as the sky rippled with lightning. Tohr's withered husk remained in meditative stillness, long dead, basking in the metronomic glow of each flashing termination. The armor around his corpse let slip a glint of light, pulsing like a guiding bannerette for thrill seekers. It had caught Tyv Lucine's eye many times.\n\nShe watched from the base, attempting to establish a safe route through the scattered fulmination. Salt-blasted dirt gave way underfoot, in places, while spindles of thatch-work glass weave held strong against her weight in others. She could feel static flow through the network of crystalline connections like conduits aching to reach out and touch the storm. Her Light shivered, welcoming the Arc surges that leapt up metal clasps on her boots, and she threw herself to another glossy foothold as a bolt dove to meet ground.\n\nThe Maelstrom calmed as she reached Tohr's body. A staff lay at his feet. The air was a screen of charged pressure around him, but Tyv knew how to find gaps. She knew how to bend away the lightning and loop Arc into itself. Lessons the Light had taught her. She slipped her hand through the barrier and lifted the plate from Tohr. She inhaled ozone and humidity and slid the Harness onto her shoulders.\n\nRoars thundered from overhead and bolts scattered across Tohr's hill. Tyv swept the staff off the ground and drove her Arc-Light into its form. The reigns were in hand; the challenge issued. She would bend the storm, and live as lightning made flesh.\n\n\n-Raiju's Legacy",

Red streaks burn in the star-sea sky beyond the vast cloud of asteroids and dust, drawing the shape of a new constellation as the Warmind launches fresh guns.\n\n\"An 'almighty' effort.

He scowls and turns back to Spider. \"Stretch your legs. No one here for miles.\"\n\nThe Spider unfurls himself, slurping a heavy vacuumous drag from his rebreather. Fully upright, he dwarfs the Drifter in shadow. \"Isolation\u2026 is not the same as protection, friend.\"\n\n\"Friendship gonna save us from what's coming?\" Drifter asks. He places his fingertips together, the space between his hands resembling a triangle.\n\n\"The odds aren't in your favor, but\u2026\" a guttural laugh ripples from Spider's belly and sends vibration through the loose-packed dirt underfoot, \"I'm the wrong one to come to for comfort.\"\n\n\"I get it. You tried running last time. Didn't work. Now you're trying to hide. Let me give you some advice: that don't work either.\"\n\n\"Hiding? the Spider asks and waits. \"The board changes.

Scared.\" He closes his hand, crushing the clod into a dense mound. It fractures into several pieces that waft away as Spider releases his grip. \"But here we are, living on anyway.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Fallen.\"\n\n\"Fallen. I hold favor among Witches, and Kells, and whispering agents\u2026 of every shade and shape. My web is vast, and I have proven useful. Let the kings bloody each other. I'll direct the runoff.\"\n\n\"You talking about Guardians? Hate to break it to you, but they're a cheap date.\"\n\n\"Cheap is malleable. Cheap becomes\u2026 cheaper in desperation.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" The Drifter pulls a small and ornate box of Awoken design from his rucksack. \"Who you lookin' for with this anyway?\"\n\nThe Spider steps toward Drifter, smothering his personal space. \"Options, my dear rogue; tangled in the web.\" He takes the box with his dominant arms and plops two stuffed sacks of Ghost shells into the Drifter's hands with his others.\n\n\"Went through hell to get that little box. Don't come with no throne,\" Drifter says, holding his voice steady, jaw tense to stay the trembling.\n\nThe Spider chitters as a shiver runs through him. \"No. Just a looking-glass window. Good business, friend.\" The hulking Fallen Don turns to leave. \"Remember\u2026 remain useful.\"\n\n\"When you find 'em, you sure the past won't come knocking?\"\n\n\"No one minds the Spider.\"\n\n\"Lucky.\"",

She reaches toward the ruined man. \n\nBefore\u2026\n\nSavath\u00fbn squeezes through the calcified channels of ascendant energy and manifests within the dangling Ahamkara skull. \n\nThe man standing below the netting senses her appearance. His Light flares as he draws his weapon with impossible speed.\n\nShe has only a moment: She pushes her face down through the ropes, opens her mouth, and sings. \n\nThe man stops, then slowly holsters his weapon. He turns, crosses his arms, and forgets. \n\nShe melts awkwardly back into the skull as best she can, though a tangle of spindly elbows, licorice-black, still juts from its sockets. She turns her attention to her quarry across the gap and hums her song softly to mask herself. \n\nSoon, the man below begins to hum along with her.\n\nShe smiles.",

I have completed my sweep through the Reef and am filing an incident report hence forth referred to as Inc-01, should it be referenced.\n\nShuffling is heard as the speaker adjusts. Papers sift and the microphone crackles slightly. \n\nRc-9: The basis of my visit to the Tangled Shore was to conduct routine Vanguard/Reef security sweeps, as agreed upon since the day of incursion. I was escorted most of the way to the Shore by Awoken gunships, and only landed once my long-range scanner picked up a sub-audio reading emanating from the underbelly of one of the larger asteroid landmasses. \n\nThe speaker clears their throat. \n\nRc-9: I called in the disturbance to a nearby Awoken vessel and was told to, and I quote, \"Mind my own business and be on my way,\" so naturally, I thanked them for their assistance, feigned departure, and landed to check it out. They didn't seem to notice the signal. At the signal's source, I discovered a small camp of what I initially thought were Scorn. Upon further observation, I found that these were not Scorn but Fallen afflicted with some kind of flesh deformity and mental degradation. Shot one dead and the others just looked at me. They didn't fight back. Fired a few cesium charges into the asteroid hole and watched 'em burn. Just sat there. I didn't hear it clearly, but they were chanting something. I don't know. Hard to hear over the fire. \n\nThe speaker laughs to themselves and emulates popping noises. \n\nRc-9: I heard more of them whispering a little deeper in, so I waited for the area to burn out and continued inside. I found one structure of apparent Hive architecture, though it did not appear to have been constructed in any traditional sense\u2026 but then again, I don't know what I should even expect from the Hive at this point. A single Fallen was inside, became violent when I approached and brandished a weapon. The weapon was not loaded, and I put them down. \n\nRc-9: My logs will show a few recovered pieces of equipment that I will list now. One presumably organic section of the Hive structure. It is perpetually wet, just\u2026 great job on that, and causes dizziness and blurred vision when held with ungloved hands. It also has the unnerving ability to project dysphoria or general unease. I was asked to collect a sample for study by my CO. I've done that. Put it in a lead box all the way in the back of the cargo hold. Yeah. Eternal tithings to Xivu Arath. Whatever. Um\u2026 as I was saying. \n\nA tin is heard being unlatched. \n\nRc-9: Also recovered: one tube-style Grenade Launcher. It has no foundry markings. Definitely not Fallen, and I don't think the Scorn even know how to make weapons. Do the Awoken make Grenade Launchers? Always struck me as a Human weapon. Beautiful weapon. The thing wants to be used. Maybe I'll get an opportunity to use it before I get back to the Tower. Lastly, I recovered a locational tracker from one of the Fallen. Following it back to someplace else in the Reef. Little remote. I'll call in my findings once I've finished there. \n\nRc-9: Beautiful weapon. \n\nThe recording cuts.",

The Last City looked like a perfect ripple of Light from above, dropped from the impassive form of the Great Machine. Ahrrha wondered for the first time in his life if the Spider was wrong about the Guardians.\n\nBut his misgivings evaporated as soon as he emerged from the drop ship. Rather than living in a gleaming city of crystal, the Eliksni were packed into the bombed-out ruins of a former war zone. The area they'd been \"given\" appeared to be on the verge of collapse. \n\nAhrrha sneered inwardly. Did the Guardians really believe that the Eliksni could be pacified so cheaply? That they were content to live under the boots of the Vanguard, gnawing at scraps? Perhaps it was true for fools like Misraaks, his Awoken-raised hatchling, and cowards like the Empty Weaver. \n\nBut the Spider's acquiescence would not be so easily bought. In fact, Ahrrha thought, the Spider could probably own this settlement within a year. The generosity and goodwill of House Light would soon crumble to greed and hubris, as they all did. And once Spider's syndicate had a foothold, they would make the Vanguard pay. In Glimmer, weapons, Ether, and blood.",
