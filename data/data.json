Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here.

All I'll say about it is\u2014\n\nOnly one thing scares me more than dying, and that's dying inside these walls.\n\nBut I made a promise to my home.\n\nI took the three new Guardians for a tour of the tallwalk today. Two of them are blue. Actually, truly blue. I can't stop staring. Their names are Therin Vai and Nadiya. The third is an Exo, Lee-4.\n\nTherin noticed my staring and laughed at me.\n\n\"Never seen anyone this good-looking before, have you?\"\n\n\"Never seen anyone blue,\" I said.\n\nTherin tried to explain about Awoken. He didn't know much. He doesn't remember anything since becoming a Guardian.\n\n\"Then how do Guardians pick their names?\" I asked.\n\nAccording to Therin, Exo Guardians usually remember their names, but that's it. Awoken and Human Guardians remember nothing, so they just pick new names.\n\nSo I asked them why they chose theirs. Therin puffed out his chest\u2014his armor looked like it had once been really fancy, but it was scuffed and dirty from the road\u2014and said, \"Because it sounds awesome! Remember the name Therin Vai\u2014it's the name of the Guardian who will find the lost Warmind Rasputin!\"\n\nWhen he said that, Lee-4 managed to look exhausted, which is impressive for an Exo.\n\nTherin talked about Rasputin and the Baikonur for a while, so to sidetrack him I asked Nadiya where her name came from. But she just rolled her eyes. \"I don't think Micah's paying me to chitchat.\"\n\n\"You're getting paid?\" Therin said.\n\nLee-4 elbowed him hard.\n\n\"Ow! What was that for?\"\n\n\"To remind you why we're here,\" said Lee-4. It was practically the first thing I'd heard her say.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" I asked.\n\nShe fixed her electric eyes on me. \"Old debts.\"\n\n\"To Micah?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nNadiya slouched against the tallwalk parapet, her head flung back to hang over the side. I thought about pushing her over. \"Good luck with that, whatever that means,\" said Nadiya. \"I'm all about new debts. Preferably other people's debts to me.\"\n\nJust then Lee-4 swung the sniper rifle off her shoulder so fast it almost cracked Nadiya in the head. Lee-4 fitted the scope to her eye and held the weapon perfectly still, without even leaning the barrel against the wall. A pause filled only by Nadiya's complaints\u2014and then Lee fired off a shot.\n\nOn the horizon I saw a shadow fall.\n\n\"Fallen?\" said Therin.\n\n\"Kings,\" Lee confirmed.",

The stench of the Taken permeated her nostrils: ozone, gun lubricant, and the sickly sweet burn of soulfire.\n\nThe fusion rifle sounded again, closer this time. The shot was met with garbled hisses and return gunfire as the Taken rallied.\n\nAfter her abandonment, Sjari had tried to move as little as possible so as not to attract the attention of the Taken patrols that periodically swept the area. But the fighting moved closer, now a dozen meters from her hiding place. She quieted her fear and let her mind go lax, encouraging them to overlook her.\n\nShe had staved off the prying minds of the Taken Psions by lowering her heart rate and entering a deep meditative trance, sometimes for many hours at a time. But each time she re-emerged into her body, its demands became harder to ignore. She was desperate for food, for water, for anything.\n\nDespite all her training, she was nearing the end of her resolve. Until she heard a voice\u2014a soft, clear whisper in her ear: \"Have faith, my Techeuns. You are lost, but not forgotten.

She'd never been to this corner of the City before.\n\n\"Mom?\" she called doubtfully, hearing her voice echo in the empty space.\n\n\"Back here,\" answered her mother, and Helena's stomach dropped.\n\nShe pulled open a rusty door and found her mother in a low concrete room, frantically packing the contents of a long table into duffel bags. Along the far wall, another woman was balling up a plastic tarp. The room smelled like chemicals.\n\nA man shouldering a large black bag pushed his way past her in a cloud of cologne, alcohol, and sour sweat.\n\nHelena noticed a small signal jammer blinking orange on the table. Behind it, an Exo was waist-deep in a rebar-lined fracture in the floor.\n\n\"Tight fit,\" he grunted as he wriggled his way deeper into the gap, \"but I'm guessing he didn't get far. I'll find him.\" He vanished into the hole.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Helena asked.\n\n\"Don't ask questions,\" her mother said as she shrugged a damp strand of blonde hair out of her face. \"We need to get moving.\" She nodded toward the far corner of the room. \"You take that pile.\"\n\nHelena crossed her arms warily. \"Mom, what are you doing out here?\"\n\n\"I don't have time to talk about this now,\" her mother snapped. \"You don't know what's going on. You didn't see them looking through the windows. You didn't hear what this one said in the ramen shop.\"\n\nFor the first time, her mother looked up. Dangerous intensity burned in her eyes. \"They're using the dark to blind us, and we're not going to let it happen. Now help me.\"\n\nHelena walked slowly to the trash piled in the corner. Towels soaked with blue fluid. Rubbery tubes, strange scraps of metal. A laminated card that read \"TEMPORARY.\"\n\nHer voice was small. \"Mama, what did you do?\"",

She feels Crow's suffering as intensely as she feels the beating of his heart.\n\n\"You want to go to him,\" Petra states plainly. \"You shouldn't.\" Something steely has entered her voice; Mara recognizes it as a warning.\n\n\"I know that too.\" Mara turns back to the twinkling ocean of stars but focuses on the vast nothingness beyond it. \"Good night, Petra.\"\n\n\"Good night, my queen.\" Petra's retreating footsteps fade away, and Mara is alone again. \n\nNo, she thinks, not alone.

The barrel was true and the spring assembly was smooth as silicone. The brass plating and custom Picatinny rail were classy touches too. Just his speed. \n\nConstruction Redjacks had pulled the pistol from the build site of the H.E.L.M. Some of their deeper combat coding must have kicked in, because they brought the piece to him directly. Banshee wondered how long this beauty had been stuck in the rubble. Hell, maybe it was buried there intentionally. Evidence of some evil deed from way back. \n\nWell, any dirt on this hardware was long forgotten by now. Banshee set to disassembling the gun, his hands working faster than the eye could follow. In just a few seconds, he had it in constituent parts on his bench. He scanned the surface of each component, looking for the maker's mark. \n\nThere! A tiny inscription on the trigger pin. Almost imperceptible, even to his digital eyes. He examined the pin through his loupe. The mark read \"B-44.4.C-6\". Seemed like a part number. Guess he'd never know who crafted it. \n\nIt really was a helluva piece, though. Whoever made it had a real eye for the game. \n\nWherever you came from, he thought, it's time to find you a new home.",
