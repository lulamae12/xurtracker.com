They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters.

He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here.

I have completed my sweep through the Reef and am filing an incident report hence forth referred to as Inc-01, should it be referenced.\n\nShuffling is heard as the speaker adjusts. Papers sift and the microphone crackles slightly. \n\nRc-9: The basis of my visit to the Tangled Shore was to conduct routine Vanguard/Reef security sweeps, as agreed upon since the day of incursion. I was escorted most of the way to the Shore by Awoken gunships, and only landed once my long-range scanner picked up a sub-audio reading emanating from the underbelly of one of the larger asteroid landmasses. \n\nThe speaker clears their throat. \n\nRc-9: I called in the disturbance to a nearby Awoken vessel and was told to, and I quote, \"Mind my own business and be on my way,\" so naturally, I thanked them for their assistance, feigned departure, and landed to check it out. They didn't seem to notice the signal. At the signal's source, I discovered a small camp of what I initially thought were Scorn. Upon further observation, I found that these were not Scorn but Fallen afflicted with some kind of flesh deformity and mental degradation. Shot one dead and the others just looked at me. They didn't fight back. Fired a few cesium charges into the asteroid hole and watched 'em burn. Just sat there. I didn't hear it clearly, but they were chanting something. I don't know. Hard to hear over the fire. \n\nThe speaker laughs to themselves and emulates popping noises. \n\nRc-9: I heard more of them whispering a little deeper in, so I waited for the area to burn out and continued inside. I found one structure of apparent Hive architecture, though it did not appear to have been constructed in any traditional sense\u2026 but then again, I don't know what I should even expect from the Hive at this point. A single Fallen was inside, became violent when I approached and brandished a weapon. The weapon was not loaded, and I put them down. \n\nRc-9: My logs will show a few recovered pieces of equipment that I will list now. One presumably organic section of the Hive structure. It is perpetually wet, just\u2026 great job on that, and causes dizziness and blurred vision when held with ungloved hands. It also has the unnerving ability to project dysphoria or general unease. I was asked to collect a sample for study by my CO. I've done that. Put it in a lead box all the way in the back of the cargo hold. Yeah. Eternal tithings to Xivu Arath. Whatever. Um\u2026 as I was saying. \n\nA tin is heard being unlatched. \n\nRc-9: Also recovered: one tube-style Grenade Launcher. It has no foundry markings. Definitely not Fallen, and I don't think the Scorn even know how to make weapons. Do the Awoken make Grenade Launchers? Always struck me as a Human weapon. Beautiful weapon. The thing wants to be used. Maybe I'll get an opportunity to use it before I get back to the Tower. Lastly, I recovered a locational tracker from one of the Fallen. Following it back to someplace else in the Reef. Little remote. I'll call in my findings once I've finished there. \n\nRc-9: Beautiful weapon. \n\nThe recording cuts.",

Those at the back surged forward recklessly for a better view, while those in front struggled against the swell, afraid of being pushed into the path of the gladiators' swords. Audience casualties were common at such affairs.\n\nTagh'al suddenly broke the stalemate with a massive cleave, aimed at his opponent's helmeted head. Thagh'urn sidestepped it with ease. His ferocious counter-slice raked across Tagh'al's armored breastplate, leaving a thick gouge in the metal. The crowd roared.\n\nFor several minutes, the massive warriors clashed. Their swords clanged in fury, scraping off one another's armor. All the while, the crowd's furor grew, held in suspense by the certainty of bloodshed.\n\nThen it happened. As the two Cabal locked blades, Thagh'urn unholstered a concealed submachine gun. He unleashed a burst of small caliber bullets into Tagh'al's abdomen at point-blank range, sending the warrior staggering backward. Those who had bet on Tagh'al howled in indignation.\n\nTagh'al pulled off his breastplate to reveal several bullet holes in his thick hide, a gout of blood spurting from one of the wounds. He looked down at the damage\u2026\n\n\u2026And let out a deep, barking laugh. Thagh'urn joined in, and soon, both gladiators were laughing uproariously amidst a spreading pool of blood.\n\nEventually, Tagh'al's laugh slowed to a chuckle. \"Well played, brother,\" he said. \"I suppose we're even now.\"",

In fact, I have just finished going over my notes!\n\nThe old crews rose in the wake of the Whirlwind, during what we Eliksni refer to as the Long Drift\u2014the span of time between the fall of Riis and our arrival in the Sol system. I believe the equivalent period would be your Dark Ages, though Riis did not have Risen, or Iron Lords. Instead, we had the crews. As you can imagine, this period was quite lawless, as the stability and abundance of Riis was no more. This resulted in what I believe is called a zero-sum game: a situation in which every gain or advantage is earned at the expense of another. \n\nSeveral fearsome individuals rose to great power and authoritative prominence at that time; the Eliksni word for them translates to \"Ketchkiller,\" meaning one who boards and wrests control of enemy ships. These Ketchkillers commanded great fleets and raided many supply routes, procuring objects of historic or intrinsic value along the way. It is exciting to wonder what treasures they accumulated beyond those we've recovered already!\n\nMany crews were abolished or disbanded over time, but those that survived did so through great hardship\u2014they are formidable indeed. But then, so is the Vanguard, and its Guardians.\n\nThank you for asking about my research into the old crews and their significance. It is always a pleasure to talk about it.

If you think a grim expression is all it takes to move up through the Vanguard\u2026 well, you may have something there.\n\nOkay, I'll start at the beginning. The Traveler chose the Eliksni and everything was great over in Riis, until it wasn't. The Whirlwind happened, the Pyramids showed up, the Traveler took off through space, and from what I gather, it wasn't a pretty scene. \n\nEramis was there for it. And\u2014credit where it's due\u2014she picked herself up, grabbed a crew, and went after the Traveler. She cut through everything in her way, dead set on hunting it down. \n\nAnd she wasn't the only one with that idea. Whole fleets of ships chased the Traveler. Lawless days. Hopeless days. \n\n\u2026See, I was here for the Dark Ages. And when there's nothing but loss around you planetside, you can still find a rooftop, sit in a snowfield.

That takes a gutful of grit.\n\nNow, don't think I'm writin' love poems to the Shipstealer over here\u2014we find her, I'm drawing down quick as you are. \n\nBut if the big old Traveler blasted outta the sky tomorrow? You bet your entire vault we'd chase after it. We'd be the new crews, going after something we knew in our bones was ours, not stopping for anyone or anything that got in our way.\n\nAnd we'd still think of ourselves as heroes, wouldn't we?",

If you think a grim expression is all it takes to move up through the Vanguard\u2026 well, you may have something there.\n\nOkay, I'll start at the beginning. The Traveler chose the Eliksni and everything was great over in Riis, until it wasn't. The Whirlwind happened, the Pyramids showed up, the Traveler took off through space, and from what I gather, it wasn't a pretty scene. \n\nEramis was there for it. And\u2014credit where it's due\u2014she picked herself up, grabbed a crew, and went after the Traveler. She cut through everything in her way, dead set on hunting it down. \n\nAnd she wasn't the only one with that idea. Whole fleets of ships chased the Traveler. Lawless days. Hopeless days. \n\n\u2026See, I was here for the Dark Ages. And when there's nothing but loss around you planetside, you can still find a rooftop, sit in a snowfield. You can go into a forest and find a moment of quiet\u2014a little scrap of peace.\n\nAin't like that on a ship. Things go from bad to worse, you just have to face it. And Eramis did. That takes a gutful of grit.\n\nNow, don't think I'm writin' love poems to the Shipstealer over here\u2014we find her, I'm drawing down quick as you are. \n\nBut if the big old Traveler blasted outta the sky tomorrow? You bet your entire vault we'd chase after it. We'd be the new crews, going after something we knew in our bones was ours, not stopping for anyone or anything that got in our way.\n\nAnd we'd still think of ourselves as heroes, wouldn't we?",

It is exciting to wonder what treasures they accumulated beyond those we've recovered already!\n\nMany crews were abolished or disbanded over time, but those that survived did so through great hardship\u2014they are formidable indeed. But then, so is the Vanguard, and its Guardians.\n\nThank you for asking about my research into the old crews and their significance. It is always a pleasure to talk about it. After all, what use is knowledge if it is not shared?",

Ain't much I can tell you that you couldn't get from Rahool, but I can't blame you if you'd rather stay awake for the whole story, heheh. C'mon, loosen up, hero! If you think a grim expression is all it takes to move up through the Vanguard\u2026 well, you may have something there.\n\nOkay, I'll start at the beginning. The Traveler chose the Eliksni and everything was great over in Riis, until it wasn't. The Whirlwind happened, the Pyramids showed up, the Traveler took off through space, and from what I gather, it wasn't a pretty scene. \n\nEramis was there for it. And\u2014credit where it's due\u2014she picked herself up, grabbed a crew, and went after the Traveler. She cut through everything in her way, dead set on hunting it down. \n\nAnd she wasn't the only one with that idea. Whole fleets of ships chased the Traveler. Lawless days. Hopeless days. \n\n\u2026See, I was here for the Dark Ages. And when there's nothing but loss around you planetside, you can still find a rooftop, sit in a snowfield. You can go into a forest and find a moment of quiet\u2014a little scrap of peace.\n\nAin't like that on a ship. Things go from bad to worse, you just have to face it. And Eramis did. That takes a gutful of grit.\n\nNow, don't think I'm writin' love poems to the Shipstealer over here\u2014we find her, I'm drawing down quick as you are. \n\nBut if the big old Traveler blasted outta the sky tomorrow? You bet your entire vault we'd chase after it. We'd be the new crews, going after something we knew in our bones was ours, not stopping for anyone or anything that got in our way.\n\nAnd we'd still think of ourselves as heroes, wouldn't we?",

It is a good question, and one that many Eliksni do not think on often enough.\n\nFor Humans, a house is a place. But for Eliksni, a House is a family. It has a culture. A philosophy of living, shared by all.\n\nThat is why the House of Light survived, even when we fled Europa. Even after the Shipstealer took all we had. We were bound not by place or possessions, but as family.\n\nCryptarch Matsuo asked me why the old crews are not considered Houses. It is a wise question. One that, perhaps, does not have a singular answer. \n\nI think it is because those who lead the old crews do not wish to be true Kells. A Kell is responsible for the safety and prosperity of their House. It is an honor, and a burden.\n\nThose you call Pirate Lords wish only to take\u2014they give nothing, even to their own people. Each raider is responsible only for themselves. A crew is expendable\u2026 a family is not.\n\nThe old crews live a sad life. One best left in the past.",
