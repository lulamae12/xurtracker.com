The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Randy can feel an almost mythic aura\u2014exotic, even\u2014radiating from the figure. He jabs his scuffed elbows through the crowd to get a clear look. When he finally breaks through, he understands the draw: the Guardian. They stand, one leg propped up on the Tower railing. Randy's Ghost talked about this person a few times before. Some kind of hero.\n\nBig deal. Randy was a hero too.\n\n\"Amazing,\" a Titan says about the weapon in the Guardian's hands. Randy looks at the Titan wearing a strange chainmail visor.\n\n\"It's just a rocket launcher. I got one of those in Old Russia the other day,\" Randy brags proudly, unholstering a launcher.\n\nHis Ghost, Dandy, nudges him. \"Now listen here, berry blue,\" Dandy says. \"What you are looking at in the Guardian's hands is a top-of-the-line wolfpack deployment device. Each firing of which unleashes hell in the form of a swarm of homing micro rockets. I've told you a flock of crows is called a murder? Well, they really should've reserved the name for this swarm instead.\"\n\nRandy holds up his Bad Omens. \"I can put a tracking module on this.\" Dandy chuckles. \"I guess.\"\n\nRandy looks at the Bad Omens. His pride turns into frustration at the mediocrity of his equipment. In a fit of anger, he heaves the launcher over the Guardian's head and over the Tower railing.\n\nThe Guardian pivots and drops to a solid stance. They shoulder and fire off the Gjallarhorn like a volcanic eruption, blowing the Bad Omens to smithereens. Micro tracking rockets hunt down and turn each piece of falling debris to fireworks before they hit the ground. The acrid-sweet smell of burning fuel hangs in the air.\n\nRandy's jaw drops.\n\nThe Guardian steps forward and places the Gjallarhorn into Randy's hands with a smile.\n\n\"Start your legend with this instead.\"",

You're sorely, and soon to be regretfully, mistaken.\"\n\nSola spits in Aunor's face. \"You have limits. You have masters.\" A twisted Light shimmers in Sola's hand as she moves to attack. \"Enjoy hanging to death in your strings!\"\n\nAunor pulls the trigger unflinchingly. Sola drops. \"Disgrace of a Warlock.\"\n\nSola's Ghost hangs motionless in the air beside her dead charge. A breeze rustles char from the patches of blackened grass around them. Her iris flicks next to the two Praxic watchdogs: the Warlock who pulled the trigger and the Titan partner who shakes a recent death from his bones.\n\nAunor turns to her colleague. \"Should we have her resurrected and ask again?\"\n\nThe Titan wipes blood from his chest plate as his Ghost patches his armor. A fresh bullet hole sits above his heart. \"No, I think she made herself clear the first time.\"\n\nSola's Ghost pipes up, \"Who says I would?\"\n\n\"You have nothing to fear, Little Light. Your Guardian is\u2026 touched. We are here to help.\"\n\n\"You mean you're here to put us down.\"\n\n\"Not presently. Give us the coordinates of your heading. Then, you will be escorted to the City in peace.\"\n\n\"You know. If you didn't, you wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"We've tracked the gravitational disturbances, yes. The Warmind had revealed the anomaly was moving through the outer system. But you know that, and you know how to find it.\"\n\nThe Ghost mimics a \"spit\" noise. \"Run back to your quiet Traveler. I won't be ordered around anymore!\"\n\nAunor's body deflates as she holsters her weapon. \"Bahaghari\u2026\" she says. A Ghost appears at Aunor's side. \"Prepare our tools. This one appears touched as well.\"\n\nBahaghari nods and slips away to follow the order.\n\nThe Striker Titan approaches and snaps his  fingers. A stunning bolt of lightning pelts Sola's Ghost out of the air into unconsciousness. \"It's affecting Ghosts now too. We should bring them back to the City. This makes five.\"\n\nHe picks up the Ghost and shoulders Sola's body before shuffling off to their ship.\n\nAunor turns to follow. \"Five, and counting,\" she whispers to herself without taking her eyes off Sola's Ghost.",
