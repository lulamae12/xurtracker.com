Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

A single console plinth rises from the floor. \n\nShe turns to an underwhelmed Elsie. \"Shaxx would yell that whenever we stepped into a new Crucible arena. Now they're all simulated here.\"\n\n\"What else can it simulate?\" Elsie asks, hands at the console, mind opening to possibilities.\n\n\"A lot of things, I guess. You have to tell it what to make, and the directions need to be pretty clear, like a blueprint,\" Ana explains.\n\n\"Do you remember\u2014\" Elsie catches herself. \"Here, let me show you something.\" She pulls a thin cable from her wrist plate and inserts it into the console, uploading her own blueprint.\n\nThe room digitizes briefly before solidifying into a small, nondescript sporting court. In place of the console is a countertop fitted with an oval disk of brass, etched with grooves forming orbital paths around a loose brass orb.\n\n\"This is a game called 'Sacra,'\" Elsie says, fingers deftly running along the grooves. She taps the orb, which ascends and floats into the middle of the court. Red lines fizzle into the air around it, each one tracing a different path. Elsie swipes a brass groove, and a holographic pebble appears at her fingertips.\n\n\"That orb has its own gravity. You get five stones to throw into orbit. The goal is to align all five in a stack at an intersection point; then they'll fuse together. If they survive an orbit like that, you win.\"\n\nAna taps her chin. \"Seems pretty math heavy.\"\n\n\"Math is one winning strategy. Rhythm is another,\" Elsie says. \"Striking an opponent's stone head on destroys both. Anything else is just a nudge.\"\n\n\"All right, sis. Buckle up\u2026 because I'm gonna kick your custom-made butt.\"\n\nElsie cringes. \"Thinking you have some instinctual skills locked away?\"\n\n\"I fly a spaceship every day. I can do orbits.\"\n\nThey play over and over, becoming increasingly competitive, increasingly matched. \n\nStill, each game ends in Elsie's favor. And each grates on Ana more than the last. She howls in frustration.\n\n\"We can stop,\" Elsie offers.\n\n\"One more.\"\n\nThey reset.\n\nThe sisters trace orbital paths and send their pebbles along them. On her fifth, Ana spots an opening and throws. Her stones' orbits align into a Sacra stack.\n\n\"I WON!\" Ana bursts into the air amid the swirls of red.\n\nElsie eyes her own slow-moving stone approaching Ana's stack. \"Have you?\" \n\nShe points as it gently drifts onto a collision course, hitting and scattering Ana's pebbles.\n\n\"Damn it!\" Ana sinks to the ground, pressing her face into her palms before lying flat on her back. \"Am I at least better at this than I used to be?\" she grumbles.\n\nElsie steps beside Ana, then slowly lies down by her side. \"No. You're exactly as bad as you used to be.\"\n\nElsie's smile breaks first. Then Ana's, reluctantly.\n\nQuiet contentment. Spontaneous\u2026 and genuine.\n\n\"But\u2026 this is better than it was before.\"",

She tooled the rifling in her barrels with the steady hand of an artisan. Her dyes, cobalt and ichor, shone bright as beetleshell.\n\nThe other, Gharhet, came from the distant plains. He traded for his wares and sold them dear, and thus he amassed great wealth. He embellished his goods with a rich lacquer the color of flame.\n\nWhen the Primus called for the strongest warriors to serve, the district knew the fighter Tlamus\u2014who had broken all challengers with her keen aim and powerful frame\u2014would represent them. Both Dhutus and Gharhet wished to outfit her with their finest pieces, as having a warrior of her status wear their colors would bring them great honor.\n\nSo Dhutus forged Tlamus a mighty war axe with an ice-blue handle and wide golden blade. Tlamus accepted the gift gladly.\n\nGharhet procured for her a Slug Rifle with bright orange plating, and Tlamus wore it proudly across her back.\n\nNext, Dhutus crafted a Shotgun, metal burnished deep as night with bright vents along the sides, and Tlamus brought it into battle.\n\nIn response, Gharhet bought a helm with thick plating and stout antlers the color of a sunset, and they were soon stained with the blood of Tlamus's foes.\n\nAnd Dhutus saw no end to this. Her shoulders ached from working the forge, and her hands were blistered by burns upon burns.\n\nSo Dhutus issued to Gharhet a challenge, and as he knew no one would raise the weapons of a coward, Gharhet accepted.\n\nThe next dawn found Dhutus on the battlefield waiting for her rival. On her shoulder was her finest weapon: a Rocket Launcher, its barrel a twisting column of seashell blue with gold trim, built as a gift for Tlamus but now wielded by its creator.\n\nFrom across the field, a figure strode forward to meet Dhutus\u2014but it was too wide to be Gharhet; too tall, too muscular. He had bought a champion to fight in his stead.\n\nAn orange sash was draped carelessly across her chest and dragged in the dust with each confident step. Studded orange leathers bound her massive arms and thighs. Strands of coral beads hung from her tusks.\n\nShe greeted Dhutus with a fist to her chest. \"I am Tlamus,\" she said, \"chosen of Gharhet.\"\n\nDhutus could not find her voice, and then Tlamus drew one of her beautiful, terrible weapons, and the rite was soon concluded.",

She feels Crow's suffering as intensely as she feels the beating of his heart.\n\n\"You want to go to him,\" Petra states plainly. \"You shouldn't.\" Something steely has entered her voice; Mara recognizes it as a warning.\n\n\"I know that too.\" Mara turns back to the twinkling ocean of stars but focuses on the vast nothingness beyond it. \"Good night, Petra.\"\n\n\"Good night, my queen.\" Petra's retreating footsteps fade away, and Mara is alone again. \n\nNo, she thinks, not alone.

A long-range scout rifle slug punched through Krilix in the opening salvo, ripping a fist-sized hole in his chest. He fell on top of Vrisk in a heap of gore as a barrage of gunfire rained down on their position. \n\nVrisk could have shrugged off the Wretch's body and seized his Arc Spear to retaliate. Instead, he simply lay beneath his dying crewmate and let the battle play out. \n\nAfter the shooting stopped, Vrisk listened to their assailants ransack the ship. A mix of guttural Cabal barks and familiar Eliksni chatter marked them as a competing crew, eager to claim the bounty set forth by the reawakened Shipstealer.\n\nBut Vrisk knew what their attackers did not: the relic they sought was not on the Ketch, or even on this planet. It was hidden in a safehouse deep within the asteroid belt beyond Mars. Once Vrisk found the courage to emerge from his hiding place, he would take the relic to Eramiskel himself and claim the reward for his own.\n\nBut there was time for that. For now, the Dreg let the weight and warmth of his dead companion press him into a peaceful slumber, where he dreamed of better days to come.",
