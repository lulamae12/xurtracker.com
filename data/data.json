Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

It had raged for years, just as it did before when Tohr had claimed the reigns and issued his challenge to Raiju's Maelstrom. \n\nClouds trundled at the storm's edge and forked bolts split through a central cumulonimbus supercell. Strikes of gnarled charge nipped scorch into the dirt with terrifying frequency as the sky rippled with lightning. Tohr's withered husk remained in meditative stillness, long dead, basking in the metronomic glow of each flashing termination. The armor around his corpse let slip a glint of light, pulsing like a guiding bannerette for thrill seekers. It had caught Tyv Lucine's eye many times.\n\nShe watched from the base, attempting to establish a safe route through the scattered fulmination. Salt-blasted dirt gave way underfoot, in places, while spindles of thatch-work glass weave held strong against her weight in others. She could feel static flow through the network of crystalline connections like conduits aching to reach out and touch the storm. Her Light shivered, welcoming the Arc surges that leapt up metal clasps on her boots, and she threw herself to another glossy foothold as a bolt dove to meet ground.\n\nThe Maelstrom calmed as she reached Tohr's body. A staff lay at his feet. The air was a screen of charged pressure around him, but Tyv knew how to find gaps. She knew how to bend away the lightning and loop Arc into itself. Lessons the Light had taught her. She slipped her hand through the barrier and lifted the plate from Tohr. She inhaled ozone and humidity and slid the Harness onto her shoulders.\n\nRoars thundered from overhead and bolts scattered across Tohr's hill. Tyv swept the staff off the ground and drove her Arc-Light into its form. The reigns were in hand; the challenge issued. She would bend the storm, and live as lightning made flesh.\n\n\n-Raiju's Legacy",

But still, the shadows remember him, and he remembers their embrace.\n\nOsiris stirs from his reverie the moment his pursuer enters the alley. He can see her shadow cast across the wall, penned in by the scaffolding's negative space. It is an optical illusion of a prison, a trick of the eye.

While his stare is ferocious, his strength is lacking. She lets him hold her there against the wall, and the moment he realizes he's being pitied, Osiris releases her and takes a step back.\n\n\"Your mind is still sharp,\" Aunor opines.

Cabal architecture blends with rustic Human furnishings that would not look out of place in the Iron Temple. Tea is already steeping when Osiris joins Saladin at the table, the aroma of black Assam bringing back ancient sense memories.\n\n\"I assume your tastes haven't changed much,\" Saladin says, gesturing to the tea.\n\n\"Did Ikora ask you to check on me?\" Osiris asks, and realizes how defensive it sounds the moment it leaves his mouth. He masks his bitter regret by taking a sip of the too-hot tea.\n\n\"No. I wanted to check on an old friend.\" Saladin sits forward, cradling his own cup without lifting it from the table. \"But I see you survived a Lightless encounter with not one but two Hive gods. I'd say you're doing better than most.\"\n\nThe pride in Saladin's voice makes Osiris's stomach turn. Not out of uneasiness, but out of shame. And yet, Saladin's certainty isn't patronizing. It's not in his nature to be.\n\n\"You're content here?\" Osiris deflects. \"Among the Cabal?\"\n\nSaladin shrugs away his question. \"Contentment is a luxury neither of us can afford. I am here. That's what matters.

He merges into a crowd of karaoke enthusiasts and surveys the room.\n\nStanding just inside the tavern entrance is another cloaked figure. Though their disguise is far more plausible than his own, Osiris can clearly identify the Praxic Warlock, Aunor Mahal.

But still, the shadows remember him, and he remembers their embrace.\n\nOsiris stirs from his reverie the moment his pursuer enters the alley. He can see her shadow cast across the wall, penned in by the scaffolding's negative space. It is an optical illusion of a prison, a trick of the eye.

On the far side of the room, Spider lords over the scene with satisfaction. Osiris watches him, intent on finding a way to discretely question him regarding Neptune. The Eliksni crime boss has cultivated a different set of informants than the Hidden, and Osiris needs intel from the widest net possible.\n\nSuddenly, Osiris feels the hair on the back of his neck stand up. Though he no longer has his Light, centuries of training have left his intuition as sharp as ever. He merges into a crowd of karaoke enthusiasts and surveys the room.\n\nStanding just inside the tavern entrance is another cloaked figure. Though their disguise is far more plausible than his own, Osiris can clearly identify the Praxic Warlock, Aunor Mahal. Osiris curses under his breath. \n\nHe retreats through the back entrance into the chill of the night. Osiris feels the darkness close in around him and wonders who among his former allies still trusts him. \n\nGiven everything, he wonders whether he should still trust himself.",

But still, the shadows remember him, and he remembers their embrace.\n\nOsiris stirs from his reverie the moment his pursuer enters the alley. He can see her shadow cast across the wall, penned in by the scaffolding's negative space. It is an optical illusion of a prison, a trick of the eye. Aunor Mahal notices the configuration and appreciates the symbolism of walking into a spider's web just before Osiris lunges from the darkness, grabbing her by the collar of her robe to slam her up against the opposite wall.\n\nAunor grunts on impact, her gaze trailing down to Osiris's trembling hands holding fistfuls of fabric. While his stare is ferocious, his strength is lacking. She lets him hold her there against the wall, and the moment he realizes he's being pitied, Osiris releases her and takes a step back.\n\n\"Your mind is still sharp,\" Aunor opines. It stings his pride, makes his jaw clench. \"What did you think was going to happen next? I'm not going to fight you.\" She looks him up and down. \"It wouldn't be sporting.\"\n\n\"I remember the day you were raised,\" Osiris says with hushed strength. \"Curled up beneath a ruined bus, screaming for help. Too terrified to listen to your Ghost, too frightened to hold the gun it had nudged under the wreck for you.\"\n\nAunor sucks in a breath through her teeth and smooths the front of her robe. \"I'm not here to hunt you,\" she clarifies. \"I'm here to keep you safe.\" \n\n\"From yourself\" is implied. To that, Osiris has no retort. He reconsiders his surroundings and his actions and shrinks away with regret.",

Cabal architecture blends with rustic Human furnishings that would not look out of place in the Iron Temple. Tea is already steeping when Osiris joins Saladin at the table, the aroma of black Assam bringing back ancient sense memories.\n\n\"I assume your tastes haven't changed much,\" Saladin says, gesturing to the tea.\n\n\"Did Ikora ask you to check on me?\" Osiris asks, and realizes how defensive it sounds the moment it leaves his mouth. He masks his bitter regret by taking a sip of the too-hot tea.\n\n\"No. I wanted to check on an old friend.\" Saladin sits forward, cradling his own cup without lifting it from the table. \"But I see you survived a Lightless encounter with not one but two Hive gods. I'd say you're doing better than most.\"\n\nThe pride in Saladin's voice makes Osiris's stomach turn. Not out of uneasiness, but out of shame. And yet, Saladin's certainty isn't patronizing. It's not in his nature to be.\n\n\"You're content here?\" Osiris deflects. \"Among the Cabal?\"\n\nSaladin shrugs away his question. \"Contentment is a luxury neither of us can afford. I am here. That's what matters. My place is here now, and humanity is better for it.\" A moment of silence hangs over the two, and Saladin is the first to brave that space. \"How long has it been since you and I took tea together?\"\n\n\"I can't even remember,\" Osiris says. \"So long ago that it feels like a dream.\" Then, quieter: \"Jolder was there.\"\n\nSaladin says nothing, focusing instead on his rippling reflection in the teacup. \n\n\"I should not have mentioned her name,\" Osiris adds softly.\n\n\"No.\" Saladin's response is swift and firm. \"I don't want Jolder's memory to fade like so many others. It may hurt to remember, but that pain reminds us that we lived.\"",

A scream rises from his mouth, and as he turns in rage, he locks eyes with Saint. Fury burns away to a cool ember of shame the moment Saint steps from the kitchen doorway. His partner is not dressed in armor, a sight few ever see. Instead, his broad shoulders are concealed by a loose poncho of magenta and lilac bearing embroidered bird patterns spun by Eliksni hands.\n\nSaint approaches and gently cups Osiris's face in his hands.
