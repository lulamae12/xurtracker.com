The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

He came to believe that each time his Ghost brought him back, he came back a new man. But he was a new man who carried with him the burden of all the lives before him. One after another after another, and each and every one of them weighed upon his shoulders in a way only Atlas could comprehend.\n\nBut he was a Titan.\n\nMuscle and might and metal\u2014a mountain of it, they said. There was no burden he could not bear. That's what they said. He nodded and waved away the adulations. He went to his quarters each night, in the half tower he had commissioned, and he laid in bed, his feet incapable of stillness as a thousand million insects scurried their way up and down the sinews of his muscles, instigating perpetual and maddening motions that all his muscle and might couldn't stop. An insurmountable restlessness that prevented what little respite he could find in his nightmare-fueled sleep.\n\nYet he was a champion. A leader. The bright shining example of all that was good and enduring.\n\nThere was a City to build. A species to protect. Extinction to prevent. Invaders to repel. Wars to fight. Lives to live. Deaths to die. What was it he said once to one of the newly risen? The Light shines brightest in those it consumes? Oh, how he felt consumed.\n\nHe stood up from his bed. Crossed to the window that framed the entity that had cursed him. Though it chose not to speak to him, he knew what it wanted. And the only way to end its curse was to give it what it wanted\u2014to destroy that which would see it destroyed.\n\nMaybe then he could sleep.",

We are here to devise a plan.\n\nDO-AJ: We had one. It was rejected. The time for that is long past.\n\nIR: Your plan was to leave the Traveler.\n\nNM-EH: We are unprepared because we waste time debating.\n\nFWC-L2: We were prepared by every conflict that befell the City. This war has been written in the stars. Let it come.\n\nDO-AJ: Mobilize the fleet. We have guns enough. Surely, that option would please Lakshmi.\n\nFWC-L2: Yes.\n\nIR: The fire from your guns would have ricocheted off the Almighty's hull. How do you plan to wound the Pyramid?\n\nCZ: This was settled during the Red War. It has not changed. We will need the fleet in reserve should the situation turn dire.\n\nNM-EH: We will not flee the seat of our Golden Age. Enact war-time powers. A Monarch must be chosen.\n\nIR: [inaudible]\n\nNM-EH: How long has that omen been left buried on the Moon?

They are supported by Guardian operatives. They will work to contain the Darkness while we evacuate nearby assets and evaluate engagement strategies.\n\n[silence]\n\nCZ: In our haste to act, we were caught flat-footed. When we choose to strike again, we must be sure of its efficacy. We may only get one chance. You have all brought wisdom to this meeting. I have considered your council. Executor, I request the New Monarchy support us as they did so graciously when the Red Legion struck. Organize the movement of our people and coordinate with Suraya Hawthorne's contacts to secure them within the walls. Cousin Jalaal, I request Dead Orbit ships ferry the wayward home and provide transit security. In return, you will both be granted full access to the Vanguard's Luna site resources.\n\nNM-EH: A late invitation, but acceptable.\n\nDO-AJ: For the time being, we will protect caravans and aid in relocation.\n\nCZ: Good. Lakshmi, Project Stronghold will require additional printings. Ada-1 has agreed to lend her equipment and expertise to assist in this endeavor. Is this satisfactory?\n\nFWC-L2: Our forges are ready and eager. We request to assist the Bray in evaluating damage to the Warmind.\n\nCZ: Offer the help. Ana will accept it, I'm sure, so long as you defer to her oversight.\n\nFWC-L2: Her standing is tenuous. We believe it amicable to offer partnership, not support.\n\nCZ: You may suggest as much.\n\nIR: Do we have a consensus?\n\n[many voices pledge in agreement]\n\nIR: Adjourned.\n\n[nondescript shuffling and chatter]\n\n[door closing]\n\n[silence]\n\nIR: You offer too much.

You're sorely, and soon to be regretfully, mistaken.\"\n\nSola spits in Aunor's face. \"You have limits. You have masters.\" A twisted Light shimmers in Sola's hand as she moves to attack. \"Enjoy hanging to death in your strings!\"\n\nAunor pulls the trigger unflinchingly. Sola drops. \"Disgrace of a Warlock.\"\n\nSola's Ghost hangs motionless in the air beside her dead charge. A breeze rustles char from the patches of blackened grass around them. Her iris flicks next to the two Praxic watchdogs: the Warlock who pulled the trigger and the Titan partner who shakes a recent death from his bones.\n\nAunor turns to her colleague. \"Should we have her resurrected and ask again?\"\n\nThe Titan wipes blood from his chest plate as his Ghost patches his armor. A fresh bullet hole sits above his heart. \"No, I think she made herself clear the first time.\"\n\nSola's Ghost pipes up, \"Who says I would?\"\n\n\"You have nothing to fear, Little Light. Your Guardian is\u2026 touched. We are here to help.\"\n\n\"You mean you're here to put us down.\"\n\n\"Not presently. Give us the coordinates of your heading. Then, you will be escorted to the City in peace.\"\n\n\"You know. If you didn't, you wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"We've tracked the gravitational disturbances, yes. The Warmind had revealed the anomaly was moving through the outer system. But you know that, and you know how to find it.\"\n\nThe Ghost mimics a \"spit\" noise. \"Run back to your quiet Traveler. I won't be ordered around anymore!\"\n\nAunor's body deflates as she holsters her weapon. \"Bahaghari\u2026\" she says. A Ghost appears at Aunor's side. \"Prepare our tools. This one appears touched as well.\"\n\nBahaghari nods and slips away to follow the order.\n\nThe Striker Titan approaches and snaps his  fingers. A stunning bolt of lightning pelts Sola's Ghost out of the air into unconsciousness. \"It's affecting Ghosts now too. We should bring them back to the City. This makes five.\"\n\nHe picks up the Ghost and shoulders Sola's body before shuffling off to their ship.\n\nAunor turns to follow. \"Five, and counting,\" she whispers to herself without taking her eyes off Sola's Ghost.",

The restraints crackle and hiss as the Hive lieutenant struggles. The Warlock glances uneasily at her captive.\n\n\"Guardian is insult. Sword Logic is death to weakness. Death to sick. Keep alive weakness makes weakness alive,\" the Wizard says and then rattles off a thick stream of guttural sounds that the Guardian's Ghost can't translate. The Warlock assumes they're curses.\n\n\"You're lucky we disagree. We value more than just brute strength. We value all the things that make strength worth having. Like ingenuity. Or kindness. Or friendship,\" the Guardian says. She scans the horizon uneasily. It's been over thirty minutes since her fireteam last checked in. \"I wouldn't expect you to understand.\"\n\nThe Wizard clacks his teeth in disdain. \"Kill makes all nothing. Dead kindness nothing. Dead friend nothing. Kill is highest.\"\n\n\"Well then, I should probably shoot you right now,\" the Guardian snaps at her prisoner. Her fireteam's prolonged absence is making her edgy. \"Is that what you want?\"\n\n\"Yes. You kill now. Is Logic.\" The Wizard shows no fear.\n\nThe Guardian shakes her head. \"You lot are the worst.\"\n\nWhere the hell are they?",

If anything, it's good for a laugh. Don't let our favorite Praxic wear you down to a nub. If she gives you grief, you give her a swift kick from me. \u2014C.Y.\n\n[Attached transcript.]\n\n\n\nRECORD: 30.10.15.C.Y.Report\nIDENTITIES: Advisor Taurun [A.T.], Empress Caiatl [E.C.], The Spider [T.S.]\nFILE//HID_CLASSIFIED//AUDIO\n\n[A.T.] The connection is made. Let the imperial record show that, on this day, the great Empress Caiatl, ascendant of Calus, slayer of Umun'arath, convened via radio message with the Spider of the Tangled Shore, formerly of the House of\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Enough, Taurun. The scribes can add whatever flourishes they wish after the fact.\n\n[T.S.] Yes, let's not waste time. I know you have more important matters to attend to. Matters that I would be happy to help with\u2026 in my own small way.\n\n[E.C.] I would no sooner seek aid from you than a war beast would from a bog-tick. Do you know how many thieves I've had to excise from my ranks? They debased themselves. Crawling about our proving grounds. Refashioning battle-trash into weapons. All because you tempted them with a flash of Glimmer.\n\n[T.S.] Ha! Me? Tempt them? It's all I can do to keep them from flooding the market.\n\n[E.C.] This is not my first time dealing with war profiteers, insect. Though, if I squash you thoroughly enough, it may be my last.\n\n[T.S.] And here I thought I was doing you a charity, promoting Cabal entrepreneurship. I was told the empire was low on funds.\n\n[E.C.] Is that so?\n\n[T.S.] Your Majesty, I don't know what advice you've been getting from your imperial hangers-on, but\u2014\n\n[A.T.] How dare you\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Quiet.\n\n[T.S.] But things are different here in the Sol system. Smash and conquer\u2014like so many traditions of old Torobatl\u2014won't get you far. Ghaul found that out the hard way. The remnants of his Red Legion have learned to adapt.\n\n[T.S.] Let me know if you'd like to do the same. I'd even go against my own custom and consider a payment plan.\n\n[E.C.] How generous. But it seems I have no need. As you've revealed, I have untapped resources at my disposal.\n\n[T.S.] Whichever ones have survived your purge, yes. But weapons are not my most valuable wares, not by a long shot. If you're anything like your father, you'll be far more interested in the information I have to offer.\n\n[E.C.] Send your coordinates. We can discuss face-to-face. But tread lightly. I've yet to decide whether you're worth my mercy.\n\n[T.S.] Oh, I'm honored to host Her Imperial Highness on my humble Shore. It's no palatial estate, but we insects are just happy to have a place to call home.\n\n[End transmission.]",

                "ExtLore": "All was quiet in the Gulch, save for the occasional chirp of birds and the gentle trickle of the river. It might've been peaceful, Chalco Yong thought as she crept along the bank, if it wasn't so damn eerie. Where were the Cabal and their noisome injection rigs? Where were the thundering Pike gangs? Evidently taking the day off, just when it was most inconvenient.\n\nThe Hidden agent crouched, running her hand over the smooth stones cluttering the shore. She was hoping to have good news for her next report. Ikora looked so tired at their last check-in.\n\nNo wonder. Even before the Pyramids arrived, it felt like their enemies were multiplying at the same rate their allies were decreasing. Now, with four celestial bodies stolen out of the sky, that trend seemed to be accelerating.\n\nAnd here she was, following a tenuous lead on the whereabouts of the infamous Light Kell into a dead zone.\n\nShe briefly considered turning her radio on and checking in, but then she saw it: the ideal skipping stone, palm shaped and perfectly worn. She picked it up, and with a well-timed flick, sent it spinning across the water. The mirror image of blue sky and pine tree tops rippled once, twice, six times before gravity outweighed momentum, pulling the stone beneath the surface.\n\nSuddenly, a frenetic rustling broke out all around her. The trees quivered as hundreds of birds burst forth, shrieking in alarm as they circled in the sky. Chalco whipped around, rifle at the ready, but there was no one. She slowed her breathing, ears open for the telltale whine of speeding Pikes.\n\nThe wispy hairs on the back of her neck stood at attention as the air crackled with electricity. A great rumbling threw Chalco off her feet. She rolled as she hit the ground. The second shockwave arrived while she was facedown\u2014a louder and more definitive thud that caused the rocks to jump up and fall back down with a clatter.\n\nSilence returned. When she lifted her head, all seemed as it had moments ago\u2026\n\n\u2026except for the once-clear sky, now streaked with aurorae of many colors.\n\nChalco leapt up and ran for the ravine wall. She scaled it, then the nearest pine in a matter of seconds. A risky move considering the possibility of aftershock, but she needed height.\n\nIt wasn't until she reached the wavery top branches that she saw it. Cresting over the tree line was the Shard of the Traveler, bleeding polychrome rays. Chalco turned her gaze up, following the arc into the stratosphere. What was happening?\n\nKeeping her eyes fixed on the sky, she flipped on her radio. Immediately, Eris Morn's voice echoed over the Vanguard's public frequency: \"This will not be the end. It will be an escalation.\"\n\nA flash, piercing in its brilliance, lit up the southeastern sky. Chalco braced herself against the tree, squeezing her eyes shut. When she opened them, the sky had returned to clear blue and the Shard had returned to its dim, jagged state.\n\n\"Huh,\" she said aloud to no one.",
