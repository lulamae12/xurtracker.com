The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

I can't take a name like that seriously, but she's got that hoarder instinct, like me, so she keeps her villages well-provisioned.\n\nWell-provisioned with an amateur security detail. Easy pickings for my crew.\n\nSo it starts with me, right? I get us in. I set it up, blow open the doors, and then I hand it off to Otto when the cavalry comes.\n\nNow Otto's a Sword man. He's all about \"craft.\" Technique. Precision. It's disgusting, but I don't care how he does it, as long as it gets done, so I just let him do it. And Otto does it so beautifully that, when he's done, you're standing there holding your guts in your hands and thanking him for the show.\n\nI slip into the supply bunker real fast and quiet, and Otto covers me. He's waiting for them when they find us, and he makes them stop short. Huge guy, Otto. A giant with a Sword and the meanest looking gauntlet on his arm you ever did see.\n\nHe takes out about ten guys armed with Rifles so fast, so smooth, that they don't even see me going for the goods. One minute we're surrounded, and then we're the only suckers left standing.",

They bore the burning sigils of War, dripping soulfire from their branded hulls as if it gushed from an open wound.  \n\nBeneath the churning sea, a Guardian Light wrapped in metal, yet to be coiled in promise, watched the skies turn to ink, and Hive fiends disembark the invading craft. \n\nProclamations scattered across the methane ocean, eager words searing each wave's crest with jade flame. The Hive's intent was clear: tear asunder the claims of the Witch Sister. Raise the banners of War. \n\nLed by a massive Knight, Acolytes descended to depths once infested by denizens of the lie, down to where the song of trickery echoed from long-dead shrieks. They marched in adorant procession, surrounded by a host of Thralls that defaced the remnant traces of Savath\u00fbn's holdings with hungering delight. \n\nHeld aloft in the claws of a central Acolyte was a Wizard's skull, recovered from the flame-licked wash before Titan's capture. The Acolyte delicately placed the skull upon a ragged sheet of conquered foe-flesh while others carved a circle of runes around it. \n\nThe Acolytes took position over the runes. They threw their heads back and howled a discordant melody that ignited the rune-circle, consuming each of them in soulfire conflagration. \n\nThe melody took hold, flooding the flesh of the accompanying Thralls with frenzy. They surged forward, kicked and clawed their kin in a mad scramble to reach the skull first. To claim it. \n\nEach time the melody thrummed, an Acolyte turned to ash. Each time the melody thrummed, spilled Thrall viscera twisted into fetid swirls around the skull. \n\nBlood and ash was offered until none remained; the Knight stepped forward, brandishing a blade of deathly menace. \n\n\"I call Xivu Arath. I invoke War's presence. Take this dreg, cast out by your sister. Take her claims as your own.\" \n\nThe churning soulflame was drawn into the Knight's deathly blade, then plunged into the Wizard's skull. The runic circle projected an ancient realm, and the Knight felt watchful eyes leering from atop a distant Black Terrace perched above that projected realm. The thunderous response pressed him to his knees. \n\nKELGORATH, I ACCEPT THINE OFFERINGS \n\nTHROUGH WILL, LIES ARE UNEARTHED \n\nTHROUGH WILL, LIES ARE MADE TRUTH \n\nTHROUGH WILL, LIES FALL TO CONQUEST \n\n KUDAZAD, BOUND, YOU ARE NAMED IN SERVICE",

It might've been peaceful, Chalco Yong thought as she crept along the bank, if it wasn't so damn eerie. Where were the Cabal and their noisome injection rigs? Where were the thundering Pike gangs? Evidently taking the day off, just when it was most inconvenient.\n\nThe Hidden agent crouched, running her hand over the smooth stones cluttering the shore. She was hoping to have good news for her next report. Ikora looked so tired at their last check-in.\n\nNo wonder. Even before the Pyramids arrived, it felt like their enemies were multiplying at the same rate their allies were decreasing. Now, with four celestial bodies stolen out of the sky, that trend seemed to be accelerating.\n\nAnd here she was, following a tenuous lead on the whereabouts of the infamous Light Kell into a dead zone.\n\nShe briefly considered turning her radio on and checking in, but then she saw it: the ideal skipping stone, palm shaped and perfectly worn. She picked it up, and with a well-timed flick, sent it spinning across the water. The mirror image of blue sky and pine tree tops rippled once, twice, six times before gravity outweighed momentum, pulling the stone beneath the surface.\n\nSuddenly, a frenetic rustling broke out all around her. The trees quivered as hundreds of birds burst forth, shrieking in alarm as they circled in the sky. Chalco whipped around, rifle at the ready, but there was no one. She slowed her breathing, ears open for the telltale whine of speeding Pikes.\n\nThe wispy hairs on the back of her neck stood at attention as the air crackled with electricity. A great rumbling threw Chalco off her feet. She rolled as she hit the ground. The second shockwave arrived while she was facedown\u2014a louder and more definitive thud that caused the rocks to jump up and fall back down with a clatter.\n\nSilence returned. When she lifted her head, all seemed as it had moments ago\u2026\n\n\u2026except for the once-clear sky, now streaked with aurorae of many colors.\n\nChalco leapt up and ran for the ravine wall. She scaled it, then the nearest pine in a matter of seconds. A risky move considering the possibility of aftershock, but she needed height.\n\nIt wasn't until she reached the wavery top branches that she saw it. Cresting over the tree line was the Shard of the Traveler, bleeding polychrome rays. Chalco turned her gaze up, following the arc into the stratosphere. What was happening?\n\nKeeping her eyes fixed on the sky, she flipped on her radio. Immediately, Eris Morn's voice echoed over the Vanguard's public frequency: \"This will not be the end. It will be an escalation.\"\n\nA flash, piercing in its brilliance, lit up the southeastern sky. Chalco braced herself against the tree, squeezing her eyes shut. When she opened them, the sky had returned to clear blue and the Shard had returned to its dim, jagged state.\n\n\"Huh,\" she said aloud to no one.",

One degree off spin-north.\" Uldren squinted downrange, as if peering into the sun. Jolyon frowned. The sun was behind them.\n\nThis was the first time he and Uldren had been to the range since their return from the Black Garden, and Jolyon was shocked by how hollowed-out his friend looked. Jolyon couldn't quite put his finger on what had changed, but there was definitely something new in Uldren's eyes. Something terribly familiar.\n\n\"Sending it.\" Jolyon pulled the trigger and missed by thirty meters. That's how far the calculations had shifted during his moment of hesitation. Jolyon grimaced.\n\n\"Nice shot,\" Uldren muttered, \"you always were the best.\"\n\nJolyon didn't even bother to hide his concern. It was clear that Uldren was also plagued by the nightmares. The nocturnal visions Jolyon dared not mention aloud. The grotesque beating heart, mangled by Vex technology, slimy with overripe pulp, thorny wires reaching outward. The wet mechanical thump of the dark beating heart, the thick beating heart\u2014\n\nJolyon snapped to. He had been drifting. He looked up to find the Awoken prince squinting down at him, as if trying to spot something in the distance. Something barely visible and receding further by the day.",

Her subject. \"You say you understand, yet you directly disobeyed my command to avoid that place.\"\n\nShe bent forward at the waist, until her lips were nearly brushing his ear. Her voice dropped to a whisper. \"Is this treason?\" The word echoed silently through the empty throne room. Jolyon's blood froze.\n\n\"Please, my queen, try to understand. Uldren is your kin by birth. By blood. There is nothing you wouldn't do for each other.\" He paused, choosing his next words carefully. \"He is your brother, but he's mine as well. He's saved my life more times than I can count. And not just in battle. He's saved me from despair. From self-doubt. When Laviska died, when my world was crumbling, he saved me from myself.\"\n\nAs emotion welled up within him, Jolyon found the courage to raise his head and meet the queen's lofty gaze. \"Uldren is my brother too. I love him, and I would follow him anywhere. I would follow him into death, if he asked. Just as he would for you. And if you call that treason, so be it.\"",
