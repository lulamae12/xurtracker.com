The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

If it were not truth, I would not come back.\" Avrok prepares to melt off one of Brivi's upper arms, and looks to the Spider for the order. \n\nBefore Spider can speak, Crow steps forward from the wings. \"If I may, my Baron\u2026\" \n\nSpider gestures for Avrok to hold, and turns his attention to the Lightbearer. \"What is it? If you don't have the stomach for my discipline, you have permission to leave the room.\" \n\n\"It's not that, Baron. It's just that Brivi's account is consistent with several other instances Glint and I have seen out on the Reef. We think it has something to do with those Hive constructs.\" Crow spares a sympathetic glance toward the prostrate Brivi. \"Besides, what Brivi says is true. If he were in on the theft, he wouldn't have come back. If you'll just allow Glint and me to retrace his steps, we may find out what happened to the road crew. Who knows\u2026 we may even retrieve the weapons.\" \n\nSpider relaxes in his throne. \"Very well, Crow. Go find my weapons. And if you locate the road crew, you know what to do.\" \n\n\"Yes, Baron.\" Crow turn on a heel and strides from the room. \n\nBehind him, he hears the Spider growl, \"Avork, you may proceed.\"",

She'd never been to this corner of the City before.\n\n\"Mom?\" she called doubtfully, hearing her voice echo in the empty space.\n\n\"Back here,\" answered her mother, and Helena's stomach dropped.\n\nShe pulled open a rusty door and found her mother in a low concrete room, frantically packing the contents of a long table into duffel bags. Along the far wall, another woman was balling up a plastic tarp. The room smelled like chemicals.\n\nA man shouldering a large black bag pushed his way past her in a cloud of cologne, alcohol, and sour sweat.\n\nHelena noticed a small signal jammer blinking orange on the table. Behind it, an Exo was waist-deep in a rebar-lined fracture in the floor.\n\n\"Tight fit,\" he grunted as he wriggled his way deeper into the gap, \"but I'm guessing he didn't get far. I'll find him.\" He vanished into the hole.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Helena asked.\n\n\"Don't ask questions,\" her mother said as she shrugged a damp strand of blonde hair out of her face. \"We need to get moving.\" She nodded toward the far corner of the room. \"You take that pile.\"\n\nHelena crossed her arms warily. \"Mom, what are you doing out here?\"\n\n\"I don't have time to talk about this now,\" her mother snapped. \"You don't know what's going on. You didn't see them looking through the windows. You didn't hear what this one said in the ramen shop.\"\n\nFor the first time, her mother looked up. Dangerous intensity burned in her eyes. \"They're using the dark to blind us, and we're not going to let it happen. Now help me.\"\n\nHelena walked slowly to the trash piled in the corner. Towels soaked with blue fluid. Rubbery tubes, strange scraps of metal. A laminated card that read \"TEMPORARY.\"\n\nHer voice was small. \"Mama, what did you do?\"",

He feared it would reveal him as the imposter and infiltrator he was, even while dressed as a House Salvation deserter.\n\nDuring the approach to Earth, Ahrrha had been overawed. The Last City looked like a perfect ripple of Light from above, dropped from the impassive form of the Great Machine. Ahrrha wondered for the first time in his life if the Spider was wrong about the Guardians.\n\nBut his misgivings evaporated as soon as he emerged from the drop ship. Rather than living in a gleaming city of crystal, the Eliksni were packed into the bombed-out ruins of a former war zone. The area they'd been \"given\" appeared to be on the verge of collapse. \n\nAhrrha sneered inwardly. Did the Guardians really believe that the Eliksni could be pacified so cheaply? That they were content to live under the boots of the Vanguard, gnawing at scraps? Perhaps it was true for fools like Misraaks, his Awoken-raised hatchling, and cowards like the Empty Weaver. \n\nBut the Spider's acquiescence would not be so easily bought. In fact, Ahrrha thought, the Spider could probably own this settlement within a year. The generosity and goodwill of House Light would soon crumble to greed and hubris, as they all did. And once Spider's syndicate had a foothold, they would make the Vanguard pay. In Glimmer, weapons, Ether, and blood.",
