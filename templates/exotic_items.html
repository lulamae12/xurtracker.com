                                    <p>What is this feeling?<br><br>I did not ask for it. I do not understand it. I do
                                        not want it.<br><br>The Crow is so carefree in his ignorance. The bonfire's glow
                                        lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where
                                        is the despairing child I anticipated?<br><br>He drinks from an open bottle of
                                        wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and
                                        they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so
                                        jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the
                                        final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of
                                        their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic
                                        annihilation.<br><br>Now the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire.
                                        Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the
                                        enjoyment of it.<br><br>I am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping
                                        shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left
                                        yearning.<br><br>What is this feeling?<br><br>I do not understand it. I do not
                                        want it.<br><br>They are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is
                                        making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine
                                        around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock
                                        by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but
                                        tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to
                                        be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.<br><br>As
                                        equals.<br><br>I am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun
                                        and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded
                                        of everyone I betrayed. All the blood
                                        spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its
                                        memory.<br><br>What is this feeling?<br><br>I do not want it.<br><br>The fire
                                        has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is
                                        fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts
                                        are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I
                                        can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple,
                                        singular focus would suffice.<br><br>There is a growing
                                        kinship here. Against better judgment.<br><br>What is this feeling?</p>

                                    <p>If Thalia is lightning, Ayrin is thunder. You hear him coming, and he likes it that way. He's got a kitbashed heavy bomber that he pulled out of a trash fire. The engine goes THUT-THUT-THUT-THUT, just these big, stupid-sounding percussive booms, and it's like all monsters, man, the noise this thing makes can stop your blood cold.<br><br>So. Otto and I load the supplies into the back, and Thalia hops into the passenger seat.<br><br>The chumps that run out to stop us are babies. That's the kicker with Warlords&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;other than ours, there's not a Ghost in sight here. Just civilians who can barely hold their guns without wetting their pants, who can't aim worth a damn, who stick their necks out for the bad guys with eternal life. Real geniuses.<br><br>Boo-hoo.<br><br>Guess what? We got hungry, too. We starved, too. So when there was food, we took it, and if the Warlords put cannon fodder in our way to slow us down, that wasn't my fault. Wasn't our fault.<br><br>Anyway, Ayrin. He stands up in the open-roof cockpit and whoops, and the little devil on his shoulder, a crackling ball of Arc energy, spits bullets behind him. Mows down the idiots as they run straight into the line of fire, like lemmings. And Ayrin doesn't need to shoot anything himself, but he does. For fun.<br><br>When he gets enough target practice, and Otto and I are on board, he lets his little blue buddy handle the rest, and he tears out of there like a bat out of hell.<br><br>See? We were a well-oiled machine. A perfect team. We could've kept on like that for centuries.</p>

All she could tell me was she scored it off some derelict satellite that crashed in the EDZ. So I ran diagnostics on them and it ebbed and flowed with massive Arc fluctuations. No pattern, no match to known solar or extra-solar events. Just random-like. So I hooked one into an old Malina vest we had lying around, and wished her luck. Word's got out, I guess." <br><br>&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;Overheard in the Tower</p>

                                    <p>When they took my Light, I dared them to do their worst. When they took my eye, I laughed and told them I had another. But when they took my Ghost... Ooh, when they took my Ghost from me&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;that was the moment their lives ended.<br><br>They just didn't know it yet.<br><br>Since my first rez, I kept to myself. Figured I'd always been that way, in my previous life and all. Joining fireteams, raiding, the Commander's Nightfalls&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;never my bag. Always walked alone. Never needed nobody. Except for Ghost. Ghost was my only friend. Got no shame in admitting that, not anymore.<br><br>Not long after the Taken War, we'd made our way to the EDZ, looking for a place to call our own. Looking for some quiet. Maybe something resembling peace. Ghost and me, we'd been fighting since the Faction Wars. Always fighting. Non-stop fighting. And I was done. We were done. We'd been running solo ops so long, I don't think anyone even noticed we were gone. And we were glad for it.<br><br>Our sudden disconnect from the Light changed all that. Like it or not, I was Guardian, he was a Ghost. Peace was never in the cards; the Traveler saw to that. Ghost reconnected to the City networks for the first time in I don't know how long only to find that comms were jammed planet-wide. So we moved west&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;to our original LZ, to head back to the City, to find the next fight. That's when they found us. The Cabal&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;Red Legion, we would later learn.<br><br>They marched us north of the Winding Cove. Set up camp within sight of the Shard. They ingested their libations. Got rowdy. They knew we were Lightless; they wanted to see what I was really made of, when I was just meat and air. I said, do your worst. And they did. Beat me within an inch of my final life and then guffawed when Ghost couldn't do anything to get me back on my feet. They ingested more of their bevvies, and one of 'em decided I had one eye too many, and he took it and popped it and laughed some more and asked me what I was gonna do about it. I laughed back, louder and crazier than they liked, and told them I had another. Then one of them, the worst one of them, took hold of Ghost, and said, I'm your Ghost now&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;I'm the one who decides if you live or die. Ghost was just a pebble in its meat hooks. And with no effort at all, Ghost was in pieces. Before the sun rose, they threw me off a cliff. They should have put a bullet in me. They should have fed me to their War Beasts.<br><br>Figure Ghost chose me because I was some kind of hero in my before time. Maybe. More likely I was just another killer.<br><br>And I sure as hell didn't need no Fists of Havoc to get my hands wet proper.</p>

                                <h2>You Get Used to Him</h2>
                                <hr>
                                <p>There is a strange fellow who&#8230 well, perhaps you've seen him. He doesn't really
                                    come and go as you or I might traditionally think. It's more that you turn around,
                                    and he is either there or he is not. His appearances are steady and predictable, at
                                    least. He's called X&#251r. I'm not sure why one draws the tiny arrow over his name,
                                    but it's important
                                    to try and respect the wishes of those we don't understand.<br><br>The first time I
                                    ever saw X&#251r, I was by myself at my stall in the Tower. The Old Tower, I suppose
                                    you'd call
                                    it now. I hadn't been there long at all. I looked up, and this man had appeared,
                                    seemingly out of nowhere! His back was to me, but even from behind, something seemed
                                    off about
                                    him. Something in his posture. As he started to turn, I noticed his whole face
                                    appeared to be covered in hair. It even seemed to be moving, gently flowing on its
                                    own&#8212but there was no wind.<br><br>When the light hit his face, I screamed and
                                    ducked down behind part of my cabinets. I was sure this abomination had come to
                                    invade us, that more of them were just out of sight, that we were done
                                    for.<br><br>Eventually, I realized no one else was screaming. I heard no sounds of
                                    distress. I peeked out and saw that everyone was
                                    going about their business. No one was panicking but me! Many people saw
                                    him&#8212several were interacting with him.<br><br>Slowly, I stood back up and tried
                                    to go about my business&#8212though I rarely looked away. Tess came over before too
                                    long, and I asked her about the strange figure.<br><br>"Oh, that's X&#251r!" she
                                    said, unconcerned. "He comes through every so often and sells particular,
                                    hard-to-find things." She considered him for a moment, then added, "Could do with a
                                    bit of a wardrobe update, if you ask me, but he's otherwise harmless."<br><br>"What
                                    is he?" I asked. "I've never seen a creature like that before."<br><br>"X&#251r
                                    is&#8230 I believe he's called a Jovian. They're from out beyond even the Reef. I'm
                                    afraid I don't know much else about them."<br><br>"But they're&#8230
                                    friendly?"<br><br>"Well, they don't attack us, if that's what you mean. I don't know
                                    that
                                    I'd call X&#251r friendly, but he's not hostile."<br><br>I felt more at ease after
                                    our conversation, though I still could not shake my fear. For many months, I jumped
                                    every time I
                                    saw him and had to fight back the instinct to hide.<br><br>Eventually, I grew used
                                    to his presence. I even began to appreciate his predictability&#8212it became a
                                    symbol that everything was functioning as it should. The fear evaporated with
                                    time.<br><br>I have often found that my first reaction to new things is fear.
                                    Perhaps it is this way for everyone. However, I have also found that if I accept and
                                    acknowledge my fear, it is easier to push through until I am no longer afraid. The
                                    new thing has almost never been as frightening as I first feared.</p>
