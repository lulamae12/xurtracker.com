My partner used to go on about it. About probabilities and random patterns used to solve the unsolvable. I never really paid attention. Outdated science never equaled a good payday, if you follow. Anyway, we used to run resource grabs along a coast out east. We found the rifle in the ruins of a gamblin' hall. In a vault ten feet thick. Behind glass, like it was someone's somethin' special&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;a real showpiece. Thought for sure we had a solid score. Funny bit was, the spot where we found it...? It was named after the math. Or, that's what my partner said. My money says the opposite, but what I know about science and history is limited to what I can sell and the sum it'll fetch.<br><br><br><br>"So, we're out in that ruined hall with loot to spare and an old-time shooter that should trade for a small fortune. Then scavengers hit. Small crew, but mean. My partner took bolts. Dropped. I tried to cover him, but the pirates were on us. Last I saw, his Ghost got scraped by a line rifle. Nothing I could do. Only reason me and my girl made it out was she was off scoutin' our escape, and I... The Fallen were distracted by my partner. But, I'm tellin' ya... there was nothing I could do."<br><br><br><br>"You were lucky to make it back... With your life, and your 'treasure.'"<br><br><br><br>"You could say that."<br><br><br><br>"You survived an unauthorized run in known Fallen territory. You found an advanced Golden Age firearm with functional tech in a sealed chamber. You sold the weapon's tech to a gunsmith you won't name for a 'small fortune' in Glimmer. And your partner is nowhere to be found&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;'dead by Fallen hands'&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;so that 'fortune' is all yours. No need to split it."<br><br><br><br>"Sure. When you look at it that way, the math ain't so bad."<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;Egon Bash, a questionable Hunter under Vanguard interrogation</p>

                                        not want it.<br><br>The Crow is so carefree in his ignorance. The bonfire's glow
                                        lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where
                                        is the despairing child I anticipated?<br><br>He drinks from an open bottle of
                                        wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and
                                        they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so
                                        jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the
                                        final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of
                                        their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic
                                        annihilation.<br><br>Now the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire.
                                        Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the
                                        enjoyment of it.<br><br>I am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping
                                        shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left
                                        yearning.<br><br>What is this feeling?<br><br>I do not understand it. I do not
                                        want it.<br><br>They are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is
                                        making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine
                                        around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock
                                        by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but
                                        tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to
                                        be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.<br><br>As
                                        equals.<br><br>I am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun
                                        and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded
                                        of everyone I betrayed. All the blood
                                        spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its
                                        memory.<br><br>What is this feeling?<br><br>I do not want it.<br><br>The fire
                                        has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is
                                        fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts
                                        are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I
                                        can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple,
                                        singular focus would suffice.<br><br>There is a growing
                                        kinship here. Against better judgment.<br><br>What is this feeling?</p>

                                    <p>Behind her, they ran for their lives.<br><br>The Fallen had descended upon them in such numbers that they were impossible to count. First it was a Skiff. Then another, followed immediately by a third. And finally, a full-blown Ketch de-cloaked above their position. There were but three of them to protect a hundred who had once been thrice that. Within minutes, it was only her.<br><br>She corralled the survivors into a cave that once upon a time wasn't a cave but more of an industrial drainage system. It was foul here; the radiation was practically palpable, and the survivors&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;if they survived this day&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;would likely find their lives shortened by years if not decades thanks to this poisoned solace.<br><br>She pushed them forward, deeper into the underground, as fast as they could manage. She carried two children, both eerily silent and unaffected. They, like their people, had endured more than she could imagine in their five-thousand kilometer exodus. They had given up their homes for the promise of something better. For the promise of hope and light and the strength of the pack. In their quest for better lives, they had lost almost everything.<br><br>Her Ghost told her the bad news&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;this cave system was a labyrinth extending dozens of kilometers with more dead-ends than not. The walls were deeply reinforced, and its scans could see but half a kilometer at best. It was going to be trial and error, and their pursuers were getting closer. Her Ghost didn't think they would make it. Not before...<br><br>One of the children in her arms&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;a little girl whose name was Violet&nbsp;&#8212&nbsp;looked her in the eye and told her, without a hint of doubt, that she knew her Guardian would let nothing happen to them. Not after how far they'd come. She smiled at Violet and told her, yes, everything was going to be okay.<br><br>She set the children down, told them to run ahead and join the others; she would be right behind them. Alone with her Ghost, she told it to lead them to safety. She would stay behind and buy them time. And by the Traveler's Light, it would be an eternity's worth.<br><br>And so, reluctantly, her Ghost floated ahead to rejoin the exodus, but not before swearing it would come back to find her and bring her back, no matter how long it took.<br><br>With the light of her Ghost now out of sight and the soft wet steps of a hundred refugees out of ear-shot, she strapped on her helmet, tightened her gauntlets, and drew a line in the muck beneath her feet. When the chittering of Fallen Dregs finally began to echo through the tunnels, she reached for the Light and with it crafted a shield of Void energy.<br><br>If need be, she would hold this line until the end of time.</p>

                                <h2>You Get Used to Him</h2>
                                <hr>
                                <p>There is a strange fellow who&#8230 well, perhaps you've seen him. He doesn't really
                                    come and go as you or I might traditionally think. It's more that you turn around,
                                    and he is either there or he is not. His appearances are steady and predictable, at
                                    least. He's called X&#251r. I'm not sure why one draws the tiny arrow over his name,
                                    but it's important
                                    to try and respect the wishes of those we don't understand.<br><br>The first time I
                                    ever saw X&#251r, I was by myself at my stall in the Tower. The Old Tower, I suppose
                                    you'd call
                                    it now. I hadn't been there long at all. I looked up, and this man had appeared,
                                    seemingly out of nowhere! His back was to me, but even from behind, something seemed
                                    off about
                                    him. Something in his posture. As he started to turn, I noticed his whole face
                                    appeared to be covered in hair. It even seemed to be moving, gently flowing on its
                                    own&#8212but there was no wind.<br><br>When the light hit his face, I screamed and
                                    ducked down behind part of my cabinets. I was sure this abomination had come to
                                    invade us, that more of them were just out of sight, that we were done
                                    for.<br><br>Eventually, I realized no one else was screaming. I heard no sounds of
                                    distress. I peeked out and saw that everyone was
                                    going about their business. No one was panicking but me! Many people saw
                                    him&#8212several were interacting with him.<br><br>Slowly, I stood back up and tried
                                    to go about my business&#8212though I rarely looked away. Tess came over before too
                                    long, and I asked her about the strange figure.<br><br>"Oh, that's X&#251r!" she
                                    said, unconcerned. "He comes through every so often and sells particular,
                                    hard-to-find things." She considered him for a moment, then added, "Could do with a
                                    bit of a wardrobe update, if you ask me, but he's otherwise harmless."<br><br>"What
                                    is he?" I asked. "I've never seen a creature like that before."<br><br>"X&#251r
                                    is&#8230 I believe he's called a Jovian. They're from out beyond even the Reef. I'm
                                    afraid I don't know much else about them."<br><br>"But they're&#8230
                                    friendly?"<br><br>"Well, they don't attack us, if that's what you mean. I don't know
                                    that
                                    I'd call X&#251r friendly, but he's not hostile."<br><br>I felt more at ease after
                                    our conversation, though I still could not shake my fear. For many months, I jumped
                                    every time I
                                    saw him and had to fight back the instinct to hide.<br><br>Eventually, I grew used
                                    to his presence. I even began to appreciate his predictability&#8212it became a
                                    symbol that everything was functioning as it should. The fear evaporated with
                                    time.<br><br>I have often found that my first reaction to new things is fear.
                                    Perhaps it is this way for everyone. However, I have also found that if I accept and
                                    acknowledge my fear, it is easier to push through until I am no longer afraid. The
                                    new thing has almost never been as frightening as I first feared.</p>
